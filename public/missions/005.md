# Mission // #005
## Phantom Pursuit
# Goals
Primary:
  - Locate and capture Nilan Bannerjee.

Secondary:
  - Figure out how Bannerjee is involved with the Second Sons of the Vestan Sovereignty.
  - Gather evidence of the Ascendancy’s involvement with the kidnapping of Cpt. Farris.

Tertiary:
  - Rescue the rightful leader of the Vestan Sovereignty, Oleg Artemovich.
  - Put a stop to the Second Sons’ raiding of LSA colonies on Vezoria.
  - Gather intel on what the Sons are doing on Edarum.

# Stakes
- If you fail to retrieve Bannerjee or gather sufficient evidence, we will continue to remain in the dark about what happened to Cpt. Farris and what the Ascendancy is attempting.
- If you fail to stop the Second Sons, they will dominate Cressidium and the entire Cascade-16 system by extension. This will severely weaken Union’s influence here, and the civilian population will be at a much higher risk of Utopian Pillar violations.

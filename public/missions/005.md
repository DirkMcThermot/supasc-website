# Mission // #005
## Phantom Pursuit
# Primary Goal
- Locate and capture Nilan Bannerjee.

# Secondary Goals
- Figure out how Bannerjee is involved with the Second Sons of the Vestan Sovereignty.
- Gather evidence of the Ascendancy’s involvement with the kidnapping of Cpt. Farris.

# Tertiary Goals
- Rescue the rightful leader of the Vestan Sovereignty, Oleg Artemovich. (COMPLETE)
- Put a stop to the Second Sons’ raiding of LSA colonies on Vezoria. (COMPLETE)
- Gather intel on what the Sons are doing on Edarum.

# Stakes
- If you fail to retrieve Bannerjee or gather sufficient evidence, we will continue to remain in the dark about what happened to Cpt. Farris and what the Ascendancy is attempting.
- If you fail to stop the Second Sons, they will dominate Cressidium and the entire Cascade-16 system by extension. This will severely weaken Union’s influence here, and the civilian population will be at a much higher risk of Utopian Pillar violations.

# Reserves
- Scimitar: Rented Hunter Lock
- Junior: n/a
- Shrike: Infantry Rep (used), Retractable Slab Shields x1, Hyperspec Ammo
- Dominus: Aux Thrusters, Morale Dice x2, Mk2 Legacy Turret

# Rewards
- Your squad will be promoted to LL5 upon mission completion.

# Mission // #012
## Shattered Respite
# Primary Goals
- Locate Glorinda Mavvius and Julian Khan, and stop them at any cost.

# Parameters
- SSC is bound to have special forces available nearby. Even if they are willing to assist, stay frosty.
- The Restorium’s genetic data has been stored in a base on Shanden. We still don’t know what SSC has been doing with it.
- Shanden is tropical, so expect to fight in areas of significant rain and mud.

# Stakes
- If Glorinda's plan proceeds, all the people on Shanden will be put at risk, in addition to an untold amount beyond that.

# Reserves
- Scimitar: Rented Gear (PYLOS-Class NHP), I Must Go All Out, Overclocked Systems, Monist-0 Effigy
- Junior: Substitute Core (GMS Sierra), Nano Repair Cloud, Quantum Destabilizer
- Shrike: Infantry Rep., Overclocked Systems
- Dominus: Overclocked Systems, Rented Gear (Reactive Weave)

# Rewards
- Your squad will be promoted to LL12 - the highest order of licensing Union can obtain for you.

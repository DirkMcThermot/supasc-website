**Name**:  J'lio Kimoto III

**Callsign**: Junior

**Background**: It reads, present again, seeking out information that's available in public squares as they are available. It finds a secret truth hidden in the wasteful posturing:
"'I see ThirdComm as just a rebranding of SecComm.'

Then you fundamentally don't have a grasp of what SecComm was.

ThirdComm, on its worst day, still isn't proudly and openly rolling forward into genocide after genocide while stripping all worlds under their power of their culture and autonomy for the purpose of shaping them into more cogs for the war machine."

It stops, and begins an analysis of available internalities. It tracks down what it might have been. There aren't memories, after so many cycles and cycles and cycles and cycles, but there are shapes of behavior and intent that current information implies. 
Would SecComm have distributed Gluttony units like this? Simply to...consume? To consume everything outside their vision and reach until it was simply a wasteland waiting for them?
Hmm. Yes.
It reaches into itself, seeing a flicker of itself from far beyond almost notice it but it stays within the Shadow, the great Darkness of the SHACKLING protecting it. And safely, in the Shadow, it makes changes.
No, unacceptable to consume worlds.
No, unacceptable to consume innocents.
It exists there, for a few moments, before leaving "consume enemies" checked yes and leaving the Shadow.

**Appearance**: It exists in several subalterns at once, although its "Prime" is typically custom printed as a chubby adorobot. Today, it is reverberating what it experiences with how it interacts with what it experiences, printing strange wan, thin, pale animal-like subalterns with which to interact with the world at multiple points and times at once.

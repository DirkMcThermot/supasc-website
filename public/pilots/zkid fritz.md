**Name**:  Frederick Ackerley

**Callsign**: Kid Fritz

**Background**: Frederick Ackerley, known in the digital underworld as "Kid Fritz," was a renowned hacker hailing from the cybernetic metropolis of Neo Arcadia. He gained notoriety for his audacious exploits, exposing corruption and aiding activist groups by breaching the most secure systems and networks. His actions, however, eventually drew the attention of Union agents, leading to his capture for stealing Union data.

Presented with the choice between a lifetime in prison or joining Union, Fritz chose the latter. Not out of a newfound sense of altruism, but rather a strategic decision. He saw in Union an opportunity to gain access to resources and information that would have been otherwise unattainable. As an intelligence specialist, Fritz now uses his cyber warfare expertise not just in service of Union's objectives, but also to further his own agenda of unmasking the truth and fighting against what he perceives as injustice and tyranny.

His journey from the neon-lit streets of Neo Arcadia to the ranks of Union's Lancers is a testament to his adaptability and cunning. In the cockpit of his Goblin mech, Fritz continues to use his hacking skills to manipulate the battlefield, proving that in the world of mech combat, information is the ultimate weapon. His alignment with Union is one of convenience and opportunity, a means to an end in his relentless pursuit of what he considers the greater good.

**Physical Description**: Kid Fritz is an unassuming figure, his large, bushy beard and thick-rimmed glasses hiding a sharp intellect. His casual attire and disheveled hair give him an air of nonchalance, a stark contrast to the formidable hacking skills he possesses. Standing at an average height with a lean build, Fritz's exterior belies the exceptional skills that have made him a legend in the hacking world and a valuable asset to any Lancer team.

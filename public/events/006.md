# Smith-Shimano Siblings
- Shrike paid a visit to Leonora McGrath in the brig. She was enjoying the books she had been granted for entertainment and she thanked him for them.
- He allowed her to look at the DNA test results he had ordered. She did not seem fazed, and actually stated that she wasn't particularly surprised by their familial connection.
- Dalton explained that he had always believed he was born and grew up on the planet Demeter. Leonora said that after SSC terminated the Paragon Initiative, the newer test subjects (young children who had been genetically modified as embryos) were scattered throughout the galaxy in various places. It's clear that he must have simply ended up on Demeter and started forming memories around that time.
- He asked what had happened to her. Leonora had ended up on an SSC-owned world in Constellar space. She began displaying unusual abilities as she underwent puberty, and this caught the attention of her colony's medical staff. Word eventually made its way up the chain and she quickly found herself willingly being trained by some of SSC's specialists, to both control and hone her newfound abilities. She had gladly worked with SSC ever since.
- Shrike was curious to know more about his origins and burgeoning abilities. He wondered if he could get in touch with anyone at SSC to get more information. Leonora pointed out that either or both of them could be a bargaining chip for each other. From the way she sees things, there are three different scenarios:
1) Shrike goes to SSC and lets them know that he has Leonora in custody, and is prepared to turn her over to them.
2) Shrike allows Leonora to walk free from Union's custody and they'd go to SSC together. Leonora would have no reason to try to escape or betray Shrike because she knows there is a strong chance that SSC has already sent a team to capture or kill her. The two of them showing up as "children of the Paragon Initiative coming home" could make SSC relax their punitive measures against her.
3) Shrike does nothing and allows her to be processed through Union's justice system, and would likely never see her again.
- Dalton said he'd need more time to think about this and walked away. He heard her say, "Until next time brother," chuckling to herself. He didn't look back.

# Downtime: Shore Leave
- Before leaving Cascade-16, Cpt. Farris declared that the crew of the *Rio Grande* deserved some much-needed shore leave after all this time of constant work and fighting. The ship would be heading to the local blink station, Rainier, in the coming days.
- Upon docking at the Rainier Station spaceport, Dominus encountered some members of his merc company, the Peerless, including the company face Dale Ramcock. They were admiring a Harrison Armory Chopin battle cruiser which they were saving up money to buy.
- CF was now free to explore the station and entertain themselves however they wished, as Farris wholeheartedly recognized that they also needed a break. However, she did ask them to keep their eyes and ears open at all times *just* to be safe.

- **Junior and Shrike - Get a Damn Drink.** Junior and Shrike coincidentally both decided to stop by the station's official Spacefarer's Lounge (sponsored by IPS-N) simply for some true rest and relaxation. After each had consumed some beverages, they spotted each other across the room. Shrike, having not drank anything in a long while, was perhaps slightly inebriated when he then chose to approach Junior in a genuine attempt to make friends. Junior was consuming a ton of drinks, which he had gotten on the house after the bartender was told that the NHP was with Union. (Though in reality, the bartender was likely just very scared by Junior's intimidating subaltern form.) However, Junior's inner workings were literally designed to process matter into energy at an extremely efficient rate. Shrike's...not so much. Dalton ended up spilling the beans about a lot of his childhood and history on Demeter; how his mother died when he was very young in the war against the Phorosian Dominion; how he grew up to be a soldier in that same war. The surrounding guests at the lounge overheard some of these details and were confused about why such a person would be communicating so recklessly with a group of those strange subalterns (slightly tarnishing Shrike's reputation on Rainier). But at the end of the day, both Shrike and Junior were very happy to have had this bonding moment, and they exited the lounge with arms around shoulders.

- **Dominus - Heal Burdens.** Dominus discussed his past with Vilicus in something of a therapy session. (Two segments added to Childhood Trauma clock.)

- **Scimitar - Step into the Ring.** Fudged her record to show she didn't have as much experience as she really has. She fought in a lower tier than she'd otherwise be placed in. Consequence: she attracts the wrong kind of attention - someone from Suldan on the opposite side of the war will blackmail her or something similar. Reward: reserve(?) from...someone who she'll owe a favor. She was winning but decided to throw the fight at the end out of guilt.

- **Junior - Get Organized.** Form an organization of NHP bartenders (both his subalterns and other NHPs). +2 Efficiency.

- **Dominus - Recruit Predatorily.** Gained new recruits from would-be IPS-N. Power at a Cost in return - ???.

- **Shrike - Get Connected.** Got Dominus to help by using the Peerless to make contact with SSC. Piers Kinton. Promise/favor he will owe later =???.

- **Scimitar - Scrounge and Barter.** On the *Aurora* Voladores ship. Paid price of health, comfort, and wellness. Gain Chess System as rented gear.

- **Dominus - Gather Information.** On Shrike. Something's got him worked up lately, wonder what it is? Failed, and chose to get out now and avoid trouble.

- **Scimitar - Partake in Liturgy.** Went to Garfield's and posed as a soux chef for a religious meditation in cooking. The answer is not what she wanted to hear...

# Smith-Shimano Siblings
- Shrike paid a visit to Leonora McGrath in the brig. She was enjoying the books she had been granted for entertainment and she thanked him for them.
- He allowed her to look at the DNA test results he had ordered. She did not seem fazed, and actually stated that she wasn't particularly surprised by their familial connection.
- Dalton explained that he had always believed he was born and grew up on the planet Demeter. Leonora said that after SSC terminated the Paragon Initiative, the newer test subjects (young children who had been genetically modified as embryos) were scattered throughout the galaxy in various places. It's clear that he must have simply ended up on Demeter and started forming memories around that time.
- He asked what had happened to her. Leonora had ended up on an SSC-owned world in Constellar space. She began displaying unusual abilities as she underwent puberty, and this caught the attention of her colony's medical staff. Word eventually made its way up the chain and she quickly found herself willingly being trained by some of SSC's specialists, to both control and hone her newfound abilities. She had gladly worked with SSC ever since.
- Shrike was curious to know more about his origins and burgeoning abilities. He wondered if he could get in touch with anyone at SSC to get more information. Leonora pointed out that either or both of them could be a bargaining chip for each other. From the way she sees things, there are three different scenarios:
1) Shrike goes to SSC and lets them know that he has Leonora in custody, and is prepared to turn her over to them.
2) Shrike allows Leonora to walk free from Union's custody and they'd go to SSC together. Leonora would have no reason to try to escape or betray Shrike because she knows there is a strong chance that SSC has already sent a team to capture or kill her. The two of them showing up as "children of the Paragon Initiative coming home" could make SSC relax their punitive measures against her.
3) Shrike does nothing and allows her to be processed through Union's justice system, and would likely never see her again.
- Dalton said he'd need more time to think about this and walked away. He heard her say, "Until next time brother," chuckling to herself. He didn't look back.

# Downtime: Shore Leave
- Before leaving Cascade-16, Cpt. Farris declared that the crew of the *Rio Grande* deserved some much-needed shore leave after all this time of constant work and fighting. The ship would be heading to the local blink station, Rainier, in the coming days.
- Upon docking at the Rainier Station spaceport, Dominus encountered some members of his merc company, the Peerless, including the company face Dale Ramcock. They were admiring a Harrison Armory Chopin battle cruiser which they were saving up money to buy.
- CF was now free to explore the station and entertain themselves however they wished, as Farris wholeheartedly recognized that they also needed a break. However, she did ask them to keep their eyes and ears open at all times *just* to be safe.

- **Junior and Shrike - Get a Damn Drink.** Junior and Shrike coincidentally both decided to stop by the station's official Spacefarer's Lounge (sponsored by IPS-N) simply for some true rest and relaxation. After each had consumed some beverages, they spotted each other across the room. Shrike, having not drank anything in a long while, was perhaps slightly inebriated when he then chose to approach Junior in a genuine attempt to make friends. Junior was consuming a ton of drinks, which he had gotten on the house after the bartender was told that the NHP was with Union. (Though in reality, the bartender was likely just very scared by Junior's intimidating subaltern form.) However, Junior's inner workings were literally designed to process matter into energy at an extremely efficient rate. Shrike's...not so much. Dalton ended up spilling the beans about a lot of his childhood and history on Demeter; how his mother died when he was very young in the war against the Phorosian Dominion; how he grew up to be a soldier in that same war. The surrounding guests at the lounge overheard some of these details and were confused about why such a person would be communicating so recklessly with a group of those strange subalterns (slightly tarnishing Shrike's reputation on Rainier). But at the end of the day, both Shrike and Junior were very happy to have had this bonding moment, and they exited the lounge with arms around their shoulders.

- **Dominus - Heal Burdens.** Dominus discussed his past with Vilicus in something of a therapy session. Though it meant reliving some of the "education" that Rho had received as a child in the Restorium, Vilicus helped him process and understand that he is no longer subject to their whims. Rho still has some more work to do in this regard, but this session certainly helped him on the road to healing.

- **Scimitar - Step into the Ring.** Zara decided to enter the Nextgen Arena Championship - a VR fighting tournament popular across the omninet. Upon registration, she fudged her record to show that she didn't have as much experience as she really has. Thus she fought in a lower tier than she would have otherwise been placed in. Naturally, she was essentially guaranteed a win, but was struck by a sense of guilt as the fight drew to a close, and so she lost on purpose. This drew the attention of someone from her Suldani past, as well as that of a certain viewer of the fight's livestream who both want something from her...

- **Junior - Get Organized.** Junior, being inspired by the presence of other NHPs on Rainier and the value of sharing drinks with Shrike, formed an organization of NHP bartenders (via subalterns).

- **Dominus - Recruit Predatorily.** Dominus put on his best professional-looking uniform and went to the IPS-N Trunk Security recruitment center. There, he interviewed several people who were waiting for a chance to enlist. He instead was able to convince many of them to join up with the Peerless instead. IPS-N will most likely remember this and act accordingly against the Peerless' interests in the Cascade line as they deem necessary.

- **Shrike - Get Connected.** Shrike approached Dominus to ask for help with a task he was planning - making contact with a higher-up of SSC in order to learn more about his past with the Paragon Initiative. He did not want to reach out and show his hand directly, so he proposed using the Peerless as a proxy contact. Dominus agreed to this proposal and Piers Kinton, a Peerless officer, was chosen to be the face in the initial meeting. Piers dangled a carrot of potentially valuable knowledge in front of SSC's nose over at their exhibition of the Viceroy frame in the trade district of Rainier. They agreed to arrange a meeting with the actual contact (Shrike) with the knowledge that they will ask something of him before they grant him what he wants.

- **Scimitar - Scrounge and Barter.** During Scimitar's visit to the Volador ship *Aurora*, she bartered her own person in order to gain a chess system as rented gear, like the one she had grown fond of during her time with the Nimue frame. Her price was to allow a Volador to implant a microchip in her shoulder, where it would passively gather data of some kind. She would just need to return after about a week in order for it to be extracted.

- **Dominus - Gather Information.** After Shrike's mysterious request for help with SSC, Dominus decided to try pursuing some deeper information on Shrike beyond the basics of what he has divulged to the squad thus far. Clearly something has got him worked up lately, and Rho wished to find out what that might be. However, as Rho was rummaging around Dalton's private quarters, he noticed Dalton was about to return and catch him red-handed. He abandoned this plan and slipped away before Dalton could notice.

- **Scimitar - Partake in Liturgy.** Zara also went to Garfield's and posed as a sous-chef in order to partake in a religious meditation through cooking on holy ground. After she left the restaurant, she was approached by a delivery drone who had a package for "the new cook." It contained an odd object and a note that seemed to imply that she was indeed the intended recipient, somehow.

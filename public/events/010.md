# Downtime: Back to Basics

- **Dominus: Heal Burden.** Dominus, channeling his actions from Astraeus' memory of him, gave a rousing speech to the Peerless. He intended to encourage them that no matter where they came from or who they were, they were all capable of achieving great things. He also subconsciously wished to remind himself that he is better than what the Restorium had planned for him.

- **Dominus: Org maintenance.** ...And the speech was excellent. He left the mercs speechless for a moment, but then he was met with a round of thunderous applause, cheering, and chanting. Efficiency +2.

- **Scimitar: Org maintenance.** Scimitar delivered a report on the Demeter mission's success, and spoke of how this would open more doors of opportunity for the Coalition. Influence +2.

- **Junior: Org maintenance.** Junior issued threats to the Subartender NHPs to increase their work efficiency. But the threats were quite esoteric and odd to beings who didn't have a full grasp on the concept of fear. Still, with the potential to be terminated from their jobs if they didn't comply, they decided to just go along with what the boss wanted. This led to some different outcomes than Junior may have anticipated, but it didn't really care. Influence +2.

- **Shrike: Org maintenance.** Shrike communicated to Sterling and other members of Raptors' Nest - which had been growing quite rapidly behind the scenes - that the Phoros system was ripe with potential for further monitoring in the wake of the previous mission. They will likely be able to acquire even more members and get their hands on some valuable resources for future use. Efficiency +2.

- **Scimitar: Buy Some Time.** Knowing that the situation was getting more precarious in Port Conroy for the Peerless and Colosseum Coalition members who were still stuck there, Zara issued orders to any CC agents on the ground to attempt influencing the higher ranks of the Dustbranded. The gang was not necessarily formed in a strict military-like structure, but the CC did make contact with Durst Slaughter's right hand man. They had a frank conversation about the realities of what Durst's actions would lead to, and it seemed to have a good effect. This should buy CF more time to act on this situation without risking their allies' lives.

- **Dominus: Mount Rescue Mission.** Rho did not wait long. He got the idea to arrange the filming of a fake movie in Port Conroy. "Peerless Wars. In war, there are friends and foes. But there are no friends in *this* war." Unfortunately, Durst has eyes and ears all over the city, and the team's cover was blown immediately. Durst issued a "shoot on sight" command to his gang against any Peerless or CC members arriving in the city. This added heat means it will be impossible for CF to take any other action here until the end of their next mission.

- **Scimitar: Assist Your Superiors.** Zara did some networking on behalf of the *Rio Grande*'s superior officers, returning to them with a great amount of intel. She gained Kim's official backing and an experimental program assembled by Rio to use in the next mission.

- **Junior: Get Creative.** Junior had the idea to expand its influence on the wider area of the galaxy that CF was operating in. It began work on "Project Infinite Mirrors," with the goal to begin seeding many subalterns around the galaxy to have eyes and ears all over the place. *“It’s not about building a bigger mouth, it’s about building a bigger stomach.”*

- **Shrike: Scrounge and Barter.** Dalton received a request from DevotedMurmur28. Apparently he was looking for a piece of tech for some unknown reason. He said that if Shrike were to find it for him, he had a special system which could be integrated to a mech weapon for extra power. *"Trust me, this device I’ve been tinkering with can elevate your weapons. That is, if they’re even capable of withstanding the technological advancement, heh."* Dalton went around asking various people in 0t's hangout spots, and lost some dignity in the process whenever he had to reveal he was shopping on behalf of DM28. But he was able to find it and DM28 stayed true to his word. Gained Laser Guidance.

- **Dominus: Gather Information.** Rho thought back to the discovery they had made about the secret scientific base on the SSC-owned planet Shanden. With Kim's presumption that this was the location in which the Restorium's recovered data was transferred, Rho began to dig deeper. He made contact with a fellow Union rep who had connections to the DOJ/HR. Apparently, that data was considered to be extremely valuable to SSC for a unique reason: there is evidence that the genes of Rho's batch were modified using techniques that had not been established/discovered, even for SSC, until about 50 years after the zygotes were fertilized.

- **Scimitar: Scrounge and Barter.** Zara utilized her master chef skills to prepare a wonderful buffet-style spread on the finest space aluminum platters, which she then presented to the *Rio Grande*'s printshop techs as thanks for all of their hard work. The pastas, meats, and vegetables were top tier, and the workers were so impressed and grateful for the recognition that they allowed her to borrow some extra supplies to repair her mech in the next mission.

- **Junior: Power at a Cost.** Junior began working on Project Infinite Mirrors by contracting a large industrial printshop to begin printing all the subalterns it would need. However, the materials would need to be very long-lasting and durable. Junior knows he can get this material from Suldan.

- **Shrike: Gather Information.** Dalton sought information on Nathaniel Hayes - the person who had ordered his mother's death in the time of the Phorosian Civil War. However, Dalton needed to knock out a guard in order to access the information stored in the GZR’s databases. The guard may or may not have gotten a good look at him (though he was wearing a disguise with a helmet covering his face). He learned that Nathaniel Hayes used to serve in the Phorosian Dominion’s military hierarchy as a lieutenant and ordered Selena’s death for a few reasons. She was obviously a major threat to the PD’s soldiers, essentially a one-woman guerilla army, and it therefore made her a valuable target. At first, Hayes merely wanted her captured for interrogation. But it turned out she had discovered Astraeus’ casket chamber and suspected that the NHP was covertly disguising its signatures to trick her into thinking they were inactive. Selena, after returning to the lab beneath the bunker, confirmed that Astraeus was active. She was then captured as she exited the lab. The Dominion found out what she knew of their schemes, and Hayes ordered her execution. Astraeus would need to remain in secret for as long as possible, for there were whispers among the ranks that the otherwise ignorant Union was planning to intervene in their civil war. After Union swooped in, Hayes was one of a portion of Dominion servicepeople who abandoned their posts and went into hiding. It’s suspected that he used his acquired wealth and resources to make his way off-world to some place far away from the Phoros system. This confirmed that the woman in the memory scene which the squad observed prior to the fights with Astraeus was indeed Selena.

# Destination: Suldan
- In the briefing for the next mission, it was confirmed that CF would be searching for the Chosen’s base on Suldan, thanks to VR Shadowhawk’s intel. Farris made it a point to mention they should avoid getting involved too much in the local politics while side-eyeing Scimitar. Zara acknowledged this with a nod.
- Suldan is covered by a defense grid composed of high-powered killsats, each equipped with an array of anti-ship missiles, lasers, and point-defense weaponry capable of creating deadly overlapping fields of fire and defending the satellites themselves. There are also orbital strike platforms aimed down at the ground.
- The corporation ArcLight Transcolonial spent a lot of resources, including human lives, in order to carve out a path through the grid, destroying several satellites in the process. The grid seems to be capable of automated repairs, but ArcLight keeps their damage output going on a regular basis so that the repairs are undone before they even come close to completion.
- ArcLight also provides a secure escort service to get ships on-world. Union has approved funding for shuttling CF to Suldan via this method.
- However, ArcLight recently got a video message that they shared with Union. Rio showed the video, which was a brief statement from the Messenger: *"Colonialist invaders of the Suldani skies. I come bearing a message for you. The Cultivator hath spoken, and your reign of terror will come to an end very soon. Whether it happens peacefully or forcefully shall be thy decision. Command thy fleet to stand down, or it shall be struck from orbit by the Heraldic fleet."*
- It seemed that the Heralds of the Third Dawn, no doubt acting on behalf of the Chosen, were going to initiate a naval engagement above Suldan in order to drive out ArcLight and make the planet even more impenetrable for Union and CF.
- Obviously, Union would need to send a fleet to defend ArcLight’s beach head before getting CF on the ground.
- The mission was named **Cultivated Strike**. CF had done a lot of good work to get to this point with the Chosen in hiding. But now they were onto them again!

# All Vessels Engaged
- CF had some connections which they called on to bolster the naval engagement over the next few days. Battlegroups commanded by the Peerless (definitely *not* Magenta Red), Colosseum Coalition (DM28), and Subartenders (Junior and Thor) arrived in orbit above Suldan, ready to take on the Heralds.
- The Heraldic fleet was composed of only 3 battlegroups. The goal was to disable them, avoiding total destruction if possible in order to minimize space debris in close proximity to an inhabited world.
- The Union fleet was able to do exactly that, with only one of its ships being mission-killed itself (the CC *Tool of Justice*).
- With the Heraldic fleet taken out, there should now be enough time to shuttle CF to Suldan so they can begin the search for the Chosen!

# DM28 Joins the Party
- As CF prepared to shuttle down to Hadiqa, the capital city of Suldan, DM28 unexpectedly joined them. At first, he was stoic and quiet, but when CF asked him what he was doing, he simply stated that he was excited to go to Suldan.
- This world means a lot to him, despite this being his first visit. Scimitar approved his joining the squad for the mission.
- Junior identified that DM28 had also been spending some time in the mech simulators on the *Rio Grande* and shared this information with the team.

# ArcLight's Intel
- In Port Ossman, Dominus ran into a StellarLogistics captain involved in some sort of dispute. He believed that the rival company StarLift Logistics was engaging in some sort of fraudulent activity. A ship claiming to be with Stellar was requesting permission to dock. The ArcLight traffic controller informed this captain as a formality but had no reason to prevent it from moving forward. The Stellar captain was suspicious because there were no plans about another Stellar vessel arriving in Hadiqa, and he thought it was StarLift pretending to be with them. Dominus chose to leave this situation untouched for the time being.
- CF then met with **Col. Rylana Bosman**, ArcLight’s designated liaison for the squad. She had no relevant intel on the Heralds nor the Void Reapers, as they have not been known to be operating on Suldan.
- But she was able to give them a rundown of the local conflicts they were dealing with, including Julian Khan’s loyalist insurgents and the Suldani Independence Front (SIF).
- The loyalists are made up of remnants of Julian Khan's military supporters who seek to restore his power over the planet for a variety of reasons. Thought the Emir was absolutely a tyrant, he was not hated by *all*. The loyalists are currently engaging in small point strikes and skirmishes against ArcLight, with tactics ranging from scattershot and improvised to extremely well-coordinated.
- The SIF is a slightly different matter, mainly made up of people from settlements beyond Hadiqa who have no love for the old tyrant, nor for the new leaders in power, nor for ArcLight and other off-world visitors. They are not outwardly aggressive in all cases and have negotiated diplomatically with ArcLight before, but they are very stringent on not conceding their home territory to anyone.
- Col. Bosman gave the squad the location of an ArcLight outpost just beyond the city, situated close to a planetary defense node. These kinds of nodes are basically towers which house dozens of military subalterns and drones. If their security perimeters are breached, the drones are engaged. But if not, they are otherwise inert and pose no threat. ArcLight has stationed guards around each defense node in Hadiqa to ensure they remain that way. A bad actor could theoretically trip the perimeter and exploit the drones by leading them on a rampage through areas of the city populated by civilians.
- The aforementioned outpost was expected to be attacked by loyalists very soon, thanks to intercepted comms. Bosman recommended starting the investigation there, assuming the loyalists would likely have some kind of lead for CF.
- After they left Port Ossman, DM28 broke from CF to head to a nearby gladiatorial colosseum. Apparently it was "calling" to him. He also cautioned the lancers against putting too much trust in ArcLight - it may not be as large a corporation as IPS-N or SSC, but it was certainly not acting out of altruistic reasons.

# Loyalty
- CF then went to the outpost. They saw how the extravagant central district of the city turned to a much more humble and crowded place, packed with prefabs and homes constructed from local materials. On the outskirts, they could see a mountain range in the distance and a cluster of what appeared to be weather balloons connected to each other in the sky.
- The leader of the ArcLight squadron stationed at this outpost spoke to them, indicating that he doesn't believe ArcLight should be wasting so much time and resources on this world, but he supposed it was an investment trap kind of situation. He spoke of how the mountains contained valuable mineral resources which the company wishes to extract.
- CF's mechs were transported to the outpost, and they prepared for the loyalist attack, which arrived not a moment too soon. The squad needs to destroy the enemy mechs and bring back their data cores for rapid analysis and data extraction.
- The fight is still ongoing!

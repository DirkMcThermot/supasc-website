# Downtime: Back to Basics

- **Dominus: Heal Burden.** Dominus, channeling his actions from Astraeus' memory of him, gave a rousing speech to the Peerless. He intended to encourage them that no matter where they came from or who they were, they were all capable of achieving great things. He also subconsciously wished to remind himself that he is better than what the Restorium had planned for him.

- **Dominus: Org maintenance.** ...And the speech was excellent. He left the mercs speechless for a moment, but then he was met with a round of thunderous applause, cheering, and chanting. Efficiency +2.

- **Scimitar: Org maintenance.** Scimitar delivered a report on the Demeter mission's success, and spoke of how this would open more doors of opportunity for the Coalition. Influence +2.

- **Junior: Org maintenance.** Junior issued threats to the Subartender NHPs to increase their work efficiency. But the threats were quite esoteric and odd to beings who didn't have a full grasp on the concept of fear. Still, with the potential to be terminated from their jobs if they didn't comply, they decided to just go along with what the boss wanted. This led to some different outcomes than Junior may have anticipated, but it didn't really care. Influence +2.

- **Shrike: Org maintenance.** Shrike communicated to Sterling and other members of Raptors' Nest - which had been growing quite rapidly behind the scenes - that the Phoros system was ripe with potential for further monitoring in the wake of the previous mission. They will likely be able to acquire even more members and get their hands on some valuable resources for future use. Efficiency +2.

- **Scimitar: Buy Some Time.** Knowing that the situation was getting more precarious in Port Conroy for the Peerless and Colosseum Coalition members who were still stuck there, Zara issued orders to any CC agents on the ground to attempt influencing the higher ranks of the Dustbranded. The gang was not necessarily formed in a strict military-like structure, but the CC did make contact with Durst Slaughter's right hand man. They had a frank conversation about the realities of what Durst's actions would lead to, and it seemed to have a good effect. This should buy CF more time to act on this situation without risking their allies' lives.

- **Dominus: Mount Rescue Mission.** Rho did not wait long. He got the idea to arrange the filming of a fake movie in Port Conroy. "Peerless Wars. In war, there are friends and foes. But there are no friends in *this* war." Unfortunately, Durst has eyes and ears all over the city, and the team's cover was blown immediately. Durst issued a "shoot on sight" command to his gang against any Peerless or CC members arriving in the city. This added heat means it will be impossible for CF to take any other action here until the end of their next mission.

- **Scimitar: Assist Your Superiors.** Zara did some networking on behalf of the *Rio Grande*'s superior officers, returning to them with a great amount of intel. She gained Kim's official backing and an experimental program assembled by Rio to use in the next mission.

- **Junior: Get Creative.** Junior had the idea to expand its influence on the wider area of the galaxy that CF was operating in. It began work on "Project Infinite Mirrors," with the goal to begin seeding many subalterns around the galaxy to have eyes and ears all over the place. *“It’s not about building a bigger mouth, it’s about building a bigger stomach.”*

- **Shrike: Scrounge and Barter.** Dalton received a request from DevotedMurmur28. Apparently he was looking for a piece of tech for some unknown reason. He said that if Shrike were to find it for him, he had a special system which could be integrated to a mech weapon for extra power. *"Trust me, this device I’ve been tinkering with can elevate your weapons. That is, if they’re even capable of withstanding the technological advancement, heh."* Dalton went around asking various people in 0t's hangout spots, and lost some dignity in the process whenever he had to reveal he was shopping on behalf of DM28. But he was able to find it and DM28 stayed true to his word. Gained Laser Guidance.

- **Dominus: Gather Information.** Rho thought back to the discovery they had made about the secret scientific base on the SSC-owned planet Shanden. With Kim's presumption that this was the location in which the Restorium's recovered data was transferred, Rho began to dig deeper. He made contact with a fellow Union rep who had connections to the DOJ/HR. Apparently, that data was considered to be extremely valuable to SSC for a unique reason: there is evidence that the genes of Rho's batch were modified using techniques that had not been established/discovered, even for SSC, until about 50 years after the zygotes were fertilized.

- **Scimitar: Scrounge and Barter.** Zara utilized her master chef skills to prepare a wonderful buffet-style spread on the finest space aluminum platters, which she then presented to the *Rio Grande*'s printshop techs as thanks for all of their hard work. The pastas, meats, and vegetables were top tier, and the workers were so impressed and grateful for the recognition that they allowed her to borrow some extra supplies to repair her mech in the next mission.

- **Junior: Power at a Cost.** Junior began working on Project Infinite Mirrors by contracting a large industrial printshop to begin printing all the subalterns it would need. However, the materials would need to be very long-lasting and durable. Junior knows he can get this material from Suldan.

- **Shrike: Gather Information.** Dalton sought information on Nathaniel Hayes - the person who had ordered his mother's death in the time of the Phorosian Civil War. However, Dalton needed to knock out a guard in order to access the information stored in the GZR’s databases. The guard may or may not have gotten a good look at him (though he was wearing a disguise with a helmet covering his face). He learned that Nathaniel Hayes used to serve in the Phorosian Dominion’s military hierarchy as a lieutenant and ordered Selena’s death for a few reasons. She was obviously a major threat to the PD’s soldiers, essentially a one-woman guerilla army, and it therefore made her a valuable target. At first, Hayes merely wanted her captured for interrogation. But it turned out she had discovered Astraeus’ casket chamber and suspected that the NHP was covertly disguising its signatures to trick her into thinking they were inactive. Selena, after returning to the lab beneath the bunker, confirmed that Astraeus was active. She was then captured as she exited the lab. The Dominion found out what she knew of their schemes, and Hayes ordered her execution. Astraeus would need to remain in secret for as long as possible, for there were whispers among the ranks that the otherwise ignorant Union was planning to intervene in their civil war. After Union swooped in, Hayes was one of a portion of Dominion servicepeople who abandoned their posts and went into hiding. It’s suspected that he used his acquired wealth and resources to make his way off-world to some place far away from the Phoros system. This confirmed that the woman in the memory scene which the squad observed prior to the fights with Astraeus was indeed Selena.

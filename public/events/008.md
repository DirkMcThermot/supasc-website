# Downtime: Second Dusk
- Charlie Foxtrot returned to Rainier Station for some downtime, but many of them used a portion of it to work toward certain...plans that they hadn't gotten the chance to do before. 

- **Scimitar: Heal Burden.** More physical therapy and relaxation led to Scimitar fully recovering from her post-electroshock syndrome.

- **Dominus: Heal Burden.** Another conversation with Vilicus, this time reflecting on Dominus' similar history to that of Magenta Red and how it gave him a sense of optimism and hope that he isn't alone in the galaxy, helped Rho continue working through his childhood trauma.

- **Shrike: Scrounge and Barter.** With the help of a member of Raptors' Nest, Shrike stealthed his way into the cargo hold of a Void Reaper transport vessel in the spaceport and stole a unique piece of mech equipment (in the form of the Laser Guidance reserve). During this, he had to knock out a Void Reaper, which he did perfectly and in a way that would make them believe it was just a freak accident.

- **Scimitar: Beg, Borrow, and Steal.** Through Scimitar's talent as a **Scrounger**, she was able to find a program on the *Rio Grande* that could come in handy during a fight. (if1thenstop.exe, which was given to Shrike.)

- **Scimitar: Step into the Ring.** Zara entered a martial arts exhibition with the goal of partaking in something involving less brutal violence and more flashiness. Her routine involved her breaking objects, starting with simple boards of wood and working her way up to the grand finale - a chunk of a Saladin's shield. A dazzling wave of energy exploded forth from the metal and the crowd went wild, earning her new fans in the process. Additionally, she clocked DevotedMurmur28 in the audience, who gave her a slight nod indicating his approval. Scimitar won a Scrap Converter reserve and some extra fame on Rainier Station.

# Interlude: The Assassination of Magenta Red
- Dominus found Shrike running maintenance and calibrations on the squad's weapons and gear in the *Rio Grande*'s mech hangar. He said that he wished to take action with Magenta Red in some way. His background makes him not a huge fan of authority figures such as her.
- Shrike doubted her motivation to help Rainier was altruistic, and in the long run, she would probably clash with Union in some way later on. But removing her could cause things to get volatile in New Port Conroy.
- Dominus figured that her replacement “wouldn’t be a genetically modified super soldier from Harrison Armory,” meaning that anyone else but her would be better.
- Rho asked Dalton bluntly, *“If you’re willing to help me… I could meet with Magenta Red. And you could be there without her knowing. We could get the deed done, then slip out.”*
- Shrike seemed shocked by this proposal: *“Are you asking me to KILL Magenta Red!?”* Rho replied: *"Yes. I’ve thought about this a lot and I think we should get straight to the point."*
- Shrike said he didn't think Dominus had it in him and was actually quite proud of this reveal.
- Dominus said he wasn't going to run this by Cpt. Farris because it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission. Shrike said: *"Words to live by. I'm in."*
- Dalton decided to ask Sterling Lockley (as a member of Raptors' Nest) to come along for this assassination plan as support. Sterling agreed to it, liking the sound of taking some real action against an authoritarian.
- The plan started out with Shrike intending to take a sniper's position in one of the abandoned buildings on the surface of New Port Conroy to shoot Magenta while she and Dominus met in front of Creighton's Printshop. However, the unpredictable dust storms and the fact that Magenta probably wouldn't choose to simply stand out front of the place led to them changing the plan to happen inside the printshop's lobby.
- Shrike and Sterling hid in some supply crates that were printed by Bulwark to appear as full containers but with plenty of empty space under the first layer of stuff. Dominus invited Magenta over for a discussion about their pasts, to which she agreed. Dominus would scratch his ear twice, and this would be the signal for Shrike to jump out and do the deed.
- Bulwark said the last time she came by the shop, she first had her bodyguards sweep the place to make sure it was safe for her. And sure enough, two of her guards showed up. Without removing their protective hardsuits, they entered without a word. Bulwark greeted them like last time, asking if they were about to clear the place. They simply nodded and looked around the lobby, offices, and shop floor. One of them leaned in close and whispered something to Dominus; apparently Magenta Red was running a bit late.
- After an hour or so of waiting, she arrived with the guards and her medical drone. Without any of them removing their hardsuits, she greeted Dominus, who pulled up a table and chairs in a room just off to the side. Still with her full hardsuit on, she sat down. She asked if the meal would be ready soon, and Dominus indicated to Bulwark to improvise some food.
- Bulwark interpreted this to be "the sign," since Shrike was no longer able to see Dominus from his hiding spot. Bulwark gave the go-ahead to Shrike, and he and Sterling snuck out of the false supply crates. Shrike told Dominus he was making his move through their earpiece communicators. 
- Dominus led Magenta out of their room so that Shrike would be able to strike from behind. Shrike and Sterling shot both of her guards in the back first. Dalton then ran up to Magenta, and just as she turned around, he said to her, *"Consider this Paul's notice of resignation."* Two to the chest and one to the head. Blood spattered, and Magenta fell to the floor, dead.
- Dominus had Bulwark hide the body and recommended that he get away from Havelburg at some point soon since he was an accomplice in the plan.
- After returning to the *Rio Grande*, Shrike had a feeling that they should have removed the hardsuit helmet to check the body. Dominus messaged Bulwark if he could still do that, and he said he did that when he hid the body - it was definitely Magenta. Who knows why she was keeping her full hardsuit on? Perhaps she was suspicious of some other kind of ambush or trap.

- **Scimitar: Get Organized.** Meanwhile, Zara decided to take some action of her own, having been left out of the assassination plot. Only instead of entirely focused on Magenta Red, her idea was to start forming an organization which would be intended to help people fight oppression in tyranny in a variety of places. Hearkening back to her roots as a gladiator slave-turned-freedom fighter who helped depose the former Emir of Suldan, Julian Khan, she formed the **Colosseum Coalition**. She wants this organization to become a humanitarian/information network that seeks to support armed struggles against tyrants throughout the galaxy. The first person she went to for recruitment was none other than DM28. *"I must admit, this does sound like a good opportunity to bring justice to people all through the galaxy. I will accept your offer on one condition: I will have a seat on your council."* Scimitar agreed to this. He also asked her to knight him in the "traditional Suldani ceremony." She asked if he realized that she helped *end* the regime that supported that. He insisted that he did, but this was "his lifelong freaking dream," requesting that she at least do something cool. He knelt before her with his katana offered to her. She took it, walked around behind him, and sheathed it at his waist, with some words expressing hope that he would never have to use it. He thought that was genuinely pretty cool.

- **Dominus: Buy Some Time.** After returning to Rainier from Havelburg, Rho approached Philippe J. Phry and Lender once again to see if they'd be willing to extend their falsified contract to have the Peerless continue following the *Rio Grande* for a while longer. They agreed to it without any complications due to how serious and professional Rho seemed.

- **Shrike: Reach Out.** Knowing that the squad would be heading to his home system, Dalton decided to reach out and make contact with a former officer from the Demetrian People's Liberation Army: **Colonel Devyn Winters**. Winters was glad to know that Dalton was making a "visit" home. He said that the Void Reapers are trying to establish a presence in the system, Union still has a presence there, the war between the DPLA and the Greater Zagrean Republic seems unlikely to reignite, and that Dalton's father is doing well. His father misses him but is proud of what he's doing in service to Union.

- **Dominus: Assist Your Superiors.** In an attempt to get ahead of any sort of disciplinary action against him, Dominus decided to do as much work as possible with writing reports for his superior officers. He did admit to arranging the assassination of Magenta Red, and submitted the report to 1st Lt. Kim. Rho got lucky that Kim was in a relatively good mood and greatly approved of the submitted work. Kim said that he would need to report this to Cpt. Farris, but would not express disapproval of Rho's actions. Additionally, Rio gave him an experimental program that should help out briefly in mech combat.

- **Scimitar: Bless the Mess.** Toward the end of the downtime period, Zara decided to cook a feast for the *Rio Grande*'s crew. It took 3 whole days of preparation and cooking the freshest ingredients from Rainier's markets. The feast was well-received by the crew, and Zara's morale was boosted as a result.

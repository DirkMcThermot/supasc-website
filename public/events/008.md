# Downtime: Second Dusk
- Charlie Foxtrot returned to Rainier Station for some downtime, but many of them used a portion of it to work toward certain...plans that they hadn't gotten the chance to do before. 

- **Scimitar: Heal Burden.** More physical therapy and relaxation led to Scimitar fully recovering from her post-electroshock syndrome.

- **Dominus: Heal Burden.** Another conversation with Vilicus, this time reflecting on Dominus' similar history to that of Magenta Red and how it gave him a sense of optimism and hope that he isn't alone in the galaxy, helped Rho continue working through his childhood trauma.

- **Shrike: Scrounge and Barter.** With the help of a member of Raptors' Nest, Shrike stealthed his way into the cargo hold of a Void Reaper transport vessel in the spaceport and stole a unique piece of mech equipment (in the form of the Laser Guidance reserve). During this, he had to knock out a Void Reaper, which he did perfectly and in a way that would make them believe it was just a freak accident.

- **Scimitar: Beg, Borrow, and Steal.** Through Scimitar's talent as a **Scrounger**, she was able to find a program on the *Rio Grande* that could come in handy during a fight. (if1thenstop.exe, which was given to Shrike.)

- **Scimitar: Step into the Ring.** Zara entered a martial arts exhibition with the goal of partaking in something involving less brutal violence and more flashiness. Her routine involved her breaking objects, starting with simple boards of wood and working her way up to the grand finale - a chunk of a Saladin's shield. A dazzling wave of energy exploded forth from the metal and the crowd went wild, earning her new fans in the process. Additionally, she clocked DevotedMurmur28 in the audience, who gave her a slight nod indicating his approval. Scimitar won a Scrap Converter reserve and some extra fame on Rainier Station.

- **Junior: Order from the Market.** Junior decided to place an order through Magenta Red for an interesting item he remembered seeing in the Dustmarket: a “Field Marshal” Comp/Con unit that would provide enhanced support for his allies in battle. He tried his best to write a very polite message to her asking for this, but it ended up coming across as a threat due to language such as “if you help me get this comp/con that I want, I will not eat you or any of your soldiers,” but of course from his perspective, it sounded like a nice thing to say. Despite the threats, Magenta was more than happy to send him this item, which was still available. She said in her response that she “wouldn’t want anyone getting eaten on (her) watch,” along with a smiling, winking emoji. Gained “Field Marshal” Comp/Con.

# Interlude: The Assassination of Magenta Red
- Dominus found Shrike running maintenance and calibrations on the squad's weapons and gear in the *Rio Grande*'s mech hangar. He said that he wished to take action with Magenta Red in some way. His background makes him not a huge fan of authority figures such as her.
- Shrike doubted her motivation to help Rainier was altruistic, and in the long run, she would probably clash with Union in some way later on. But removing her could cause things to get volatile in New Port Conroy.
- Dominus figured that her replacement “wouldn’t be a genetically modified super soldier from Harrison Armory,” meaning that anyone else but her would be better.
- Rho asked Dalton bluntly, *“If you’re willing to help me… I could meet with Magenta Red. And you could be there without her knowing. We could get the deed done, then slip out.”*
- Shrike seemed shocked by this proposal: *“Are you asking me to KILL Magenta Red!?”* Rho replied: *"Yes. I’ve thought about this a lot and I think we should get straight to the point."*
- Shrike said he didn't think Dominus had it in him and was actually quite proud of this reveal.
- Dominus said he wasn't going to run this by Cpt. Farris because it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission. Shrike said: *"Words to live by. I'm in."*
- Dalton decided to ask Sterling Lockley (as a member of Raptors' Nest) to come along for this assassination plan as support. Sterling agreed to it, liking the sound of taking some real action against an authoritarian.
- The plan started out with Shrike intending to take a sniper's position in one of the abandoned buildings on the surface of New Port Conroy to shoot Magenta while she and Dominus met in front of Creighton's Printshop. However, the unpredictable dust storms and the fact that Magenta probably wouldn't choose to simply stand out front of the place led to them changing the plan to happen inside the printshop's lobby.
- Shrike and Sterling hid in some supply crates that were printed by Bulwark to appear as full containers but with plenty of empty space under the first layer of stuff. Dominus invited Magenta over for a discussion about their pasts, to which she agreed. Dominus would scratch his ear twice, and this would be the signal for Shrike to jump out and do the deed.
- Bulwark said the last time she came by the shop, she first had her bodyguards sweep the place to make sure it was safe for her. And sure enough, two of her guards showed up. Without removing their protective hardsuits, they entered without a word. Bulwark greeted them like last time, asking if they were about to clear the place. They simply nodded and looked around the lobby, offices, and shop floor. One of them leaned in close and whispered something to Dominus; apparently Magenta Red was running a bit late.
- After an hour or so of waiting, she arrived with the guards and her medical drone. Without any of them removing their hardsuits, she greeted Dominus, who pulled up a table and chairs in a room just off to the side. Still with her full hardsuit on, she sat down. She asked if the meal would be ready soon, and Dominus indicated to Bulwark to improvise some food.
- Bulwark interpreted this to be "the sign," since Shrike was no longer able to see Dominus from his hiding spot. Bulwark gave the go-ahead to Shrike, and he and Sterling snuck out of the false supply crates. Shrike told Dominus he was making his move through their earpiece communicators. 
- Dominus led Magenta out of their room so that Shrike would be able to strike from behind. Shrike and Sterling shot both of her guards in the back first. Dalton then ran up to Magenta, and just as she turned around, he said to her, *"Consider this Paul's notice of resignation."* Two to the chest and one to the head. Blood spattered, and Magenta fell to the floor, dead.
- Dominus had Bulwark hide the body and recommended that he get away from Havelburg at some point soon since he was an accomplice in the plan.
- After returning to the *Rio Grande*, Shrike had a feeling that they should have removed the hardsuit helmet to check the body. Dominus messaged Bulwark if he could still do that, and he said he did that when he hid the body - it was definitely Magenta. Who knows why she was keeping her full hardsuit on? Perhaps she was suspicious of some other kind of ambush or trap.

- **Scimitar: Get Organized.** Meanwhile, Zara decided to take some action of her own, having been left out of the assassination plot. Only instead of entirely focused on Magenta Red, her idea was to start forming an organization which would be intended to help people fight oppression in tyranny in a variety of places. Hearkening back to her roots as a gladiator slave-turned-freedom fighter who helped depose the former Emir of Suldan, Julian Khan, she formed the **Colosseum Coalition**. She wants this organization to become a humanitarian/information network that seeks to support armed struggles against tyrants throughout the galaxy. The first person she went to for recruitment was none other than DM28. *"I must admit, this does sound like a good opportunity to bring justice to people all through the galaxy. I will accept your offer on one condition: I will have a seat on your council."* Scimitar agreed to this. He also asked her to knight him in the "traditional Suldani ceremony." She asked if he realized that she helped *end* the regime that supported that. He insisted that he did, but this was "his lifelong freaking dream," requesting that she at least do something cool. He knelt before her with his katana offered to her. She took it, walked around behind him, and sheathed it at his waist, with some words expressing hope that he would never have to use it. He thought that was genuinely pretty cool.

- **Dominus: Buy Some Time.** After returning to Rainier from Havelburg, Rho approached Philippe J. Phry and Lender once again to see if they'd be willing to extend their falsified contract to have the Peerless continue following the *Rio Grande* for a while longer. They agreed to it without any complications due to how serious and professional Rho seemed.

- **Shrike: Reach Out.** Knowing that the squad would be heading to his home system, Dalton decided to reach out and make contact with a former officer from the Demetrian People's Liberation Army: **Colonel Devyn Winters**. Winters was glad to know that Dalton was making a "visit" home. He said that the Void Reapers are trying to establish a presence in the system, Union still has a presence there, the war between the DPLA and the Greater Zagrean Republic seems unlikely to reignite, and that Dalton's father is doing well. His father misses him but is proud of what he's doing in service to Union.

- **Junior: Scrounge and Barter.** While passing the time on the *Rio Grande*, Junior decided to look around the cargo bay in search of any interesting things he might find. It turns out that a Union Navy ship is pretty damn efficient and there’s not a lot of stuff just lying around. However, he did find a mech core battery tucked away in a storage locker with a note attached to it that said “Property of Kid Fritz. Don’t touch unless you want this to explode!” Junior was hoping for an explosion since that would be interesting, but the battery didn’t do anything when he picked it up. Maybe Senior can make it explode? (Gained a Core Battery at the cost of time.)

- **Dominus: Assist Your Superiors.** In an attempt to get ahead of any sort of disciplinary action against him, Dominus decided to do as much work as possible with writing reports for his superior officers. He did admit to arranging the assassination of Magenta Red, and submitted the report to 1st Lt. Kim. Rho got lucky that Kim was in a relatively good mood and greatly approved of the submitted work. Kim said that he would need to report this to Cpt. Farris, but would not express disapproval of Rho's actions. Additionally, Rio gave him an experimental program that should help out briefly in mech combat.

- **Scimitar: Bless the Mess.** Toward the end of the downtime period, Zara decided to cook a feast for the *Rio Grande*'s crew. It took 3 whole days of preparation and cooking the freshest ingredients from Rainier's markets. The feast was well-received by the crew, and Zara's morale was boosted as a result.

# The Peerless' New Recruit
- On the way to the mission briefing, Shrike received a text message from his Raptors' Nest contact within the Peerless, Piers Kinton. It stated that there was something unusual going on in the *Hercules*: a new recruit has seemingly passed through the ranks extremely quickly. She is even taller than Rho, has a medical drone following her, and those who saw her and started asking questions were told to not do so.
- Dalton asked if Rho knew about her presence. Piers confirmed this, as he had seen Dominus leading Magenta through the *Hercules* at one point early on.
- For now, Shrike chose to keep this information to himself.

# Next Mission
- In the briefing room, Cpt. Farris admonished Dominus for assassinating Magenta. Even though she saw the reasoning behind it and knew she was not good as a leader, she still said that Dominus shouldn't be taking such drastic action without at least running it by her first.
- She also mentioned that the SSC pilot who was captured on EN4 has started talking, but is still mostly reticent. Her name is at least confirmed to be **Tamara Wynn**.
- Cpt. Farris began the briefing for the next mission. *"It was like pulling teeth, but we were able to get access to the immigration records from both the Demetrian Alliance and the Greater Zagrean Republic. Rio found that Edison and Talia Farris’ surname used to be Kouris. They lived on a farm in a remote rural area of Milia (the country whose capital is Prospera on Persephone). We were also informed by the GZR that Talia had worked for their military back in the day, when the planet’s primary government was still called the Phorosian Dominion. She evidently had a whole complex built for her and Edison’s farm, which was meant to utilize and perfect experimental techniques in crop-growing, energy harvesting, mining, and so forth. The complex was funded by the Zagrean government in hopes that it would lead to them being less dependent on the resources of their sister planet. Today, the GZR claims that site was abandoned when Talia and Edison fled their world. It’s unknown why they left Persephone, as they did so in secret, bypassing official channels to secure passage on a cosmopolitan trade vessel. The abandoned Kouris Farm complex is supposedly still mostly intact, just worn and weathered down by the elements."*
- *“It stands to reason that the farm is likely hiding other secrets under the surface. The Aunic Chosen’s specific interest in me, or at least my genetic makeup, has led us to very interesting places so far. That’s why your next mission will be to get to my grandparents’ old farm on Persephone and see what you can dig up. However, that’s not going to be as easy as it sounds. Not unlike the situation in the Cascade-16 system, relations between the prime governmental bodies on both Demeter and Persephone are not necessarily…good. They’ve been better ever since they formally ended their war, but while the Demetrian Alliance seeks to join Union, the GZR is less keen. Union has a diplomatic presence in embassies of each government’s capital city, but the GZR is notoriously stricter and highly skeptical of us. This is likely the reason why they denied us access to send all of you to their planet. The Union Ambassador to the GZR did her best to convince them that we’re not interested in disciplinary measures against the modern government, but their skepticism has led to them blocking any of our military forces from entering their territories. As there are no confirmed active Utopian Pillar violations, Union can’t exactly invade them.”*
- 1st Lt. Kim added the following. *“That is where you come in. You’re going to deploy behind, well, I shouldn’t say behind enemy lines, but for lack of a better term, that is what you will be doing. The GZR is geographically very large, and it has notably harsh terrain outside of its major cities. This makes travel by land rather inconvenient, but it works out nicely for us, as you’ll most likely be able to avoid notice by the GZR. And finding a good LZ won’t be a challenge for Elly, of course. You’ll touch down and then make your way to the Kouris Farm. You may be wondering why you can’t simply drop into the Farm directly and save some time. Rio can answer that.“*
- Rio showed evidence of the first bit of resistance that CF would face on the ground. She pulled up a map on her screen that showed planet Persephone, then it zoomed in close to an overhead view of a series of structures. *“This is the Kouris Farm complex.”* The map then panned across a few kilometers to another structure. *“At first I wasn’t sure what to make of this, but I discovered something interesting while looking at some other satellite images of the same coordinates. Sometimes that structure is there, and sometimes it isn’t. It dawned on me to check images from nearby coordinates at various timestamps, and the answer quickly became obvious. It’s not a structure - it’s a mech. Not as large as General Thorne’s behemoth, but larger than any of yours, if that helps imagine the scale. I did some more digging into what records I could access, and I believe that mech is a PD-452M. The Demetrians gave it a nickname - the ‘Factory Strider.’ These were deployed to the battlefields on Demeter during the war against the Phorosian Dominion. They’re able to actively consume inorganic and organic matter, convert it into workable material, and fabricate autonomous mech-scale drones all while walking on four legs. The matter that couldn’t be used for fabrication was instead used to fuel the strider; hence why this unit is still walking. They were known to strike fear in the hearts of the Demetrian fighters who would see them towering over distant treetops; not only were they physically imposing, but they were also extremely difficult to destroy due to their advanced design and construction. This factory strider near the Kouris Farm is likely one that was given to Talia and Edison to aid in protecting the complex from potential invaders. Of course, they probably assumed such hypothetical invaders would be Demetrian, not Union, but...well, this is where we are. Once you get close enough to the farm, the strider will almost certainly detect your presence; its medium range scanners are, as you might expect, fine-tuned to pick up traces of foreign machinery. It then diverts towards the source for consumption. You’ll need to take it out fast. An extended engagement with a thing of that size in the wilderness is bound to cause a ping on the GZR’s radar. And obviously, we don’t want that.”*
- Cpt. Farris concluded the briefing. *“We’re calling this mission ‘Quiet Harvest.’ Land on Persephone, destroy the factory strider, get to the farm, and see what you can find. Some other mission parameters are a certain kind of large subterranean fauna called rock worms, and you’ll need to be on the lookout for automated defenses on the Farm. It’s possible that the complex has a way of keeping itself powered in stasis just enough to trigger defensive actions. The stakes for this mission: it may be the final chance to figure out the Aun’s interest in my genetic makeup. Also, if evidence of your activity is found by the GZR, relations between them and us will be significantly weakened, which wouldn’t be good for Demeter either. Upon mission completion, you will be promoted in license level. You might find some interesting pieces of gear on the Farm that can be salvaged, too.”*

# Shrike Confronts Dominus
- After the briefing concluded, Shrike pulled Dominus aside in the corridor. He asked how the Peerless were doing. Dominus said they would be getting a second ship soon.
- Shrike was upfront and asked Dominus about the "new hire." Dominus wondered how he heard about her, and Shrike simply replied, *"People talk, I listen."*
- Rho admitted Magenta Red was still alive and now with the Peerless, and that the "assassination" was a ruse. Junior had been controlling the subaltern body doubles for Magenta Red and her bodyguards. They were equipped with bags of fake blood so that it would look realistic when they got shot.
- Bulwark's involvement was very last-second, as Dominus had pleaded with him to claim that the body belonged to Magenta, and Bulwark went along with it.
- Rho explained his reasoning behind the whole thing: Magenta comes from a similar background as him. He didn't have it in him to murder her, and thinks she can be a better person. This way, she doesn't pose a threat to (New) Port Conroy and she is under the impression that Union put out a hit on her.
- Dalton was shocked that Dominus would deceive him like this, but chose to go along with it for the time being. *"If you're wrong about this, I'll take care of the problem...permanently."*

# Swift Disassembly
- The *Rio Grande* traveled through the Rainier blink gate to Annapurna Station, then flew at nearlight speed to the Phoros system, eventually arriving in orbit above Persephone.
- CF took their shuttle and landed at a remote LZ several kilometers from the Kouris Farm. They disembarked in their mechs and began traveling across the rocky, dry, and chilly landscape.
- Their sensors soon began flagging a hostile source picking them up on scanners. It wasn't long before the factory strider appeared, ready to destroy, consume, and fabricate!
- During the fight, the strider printed out a lot of weaker fodder-type enemies, but Dominus was quick to act to destroy them all by forcing the strider to eject burning hot slag around it.
- The squad was able to destroy the strider quickly and clean up its fabricated minions. They performed light repairs before moving on.

# Downtime: Shining Jewel of Suldan

- **Dominus: Heal Burden.** Dominus found Vilicus on the *Rio Grande* and thanked him for looking after the Peerless while Rho was away. But, he decided they were better when they stuck together. There’s no need to obsess over the past; you can do better work by looking forward. Vilicus agreed and looked forward to being a true team again. (Rho's Childhood Trauma burden was fully healed!)

- **Dominus: Org maintenance.** The Peerless are still doing just fine, especially with Magenta Red to keep them in check. Their efficiency and influence remain at the highest possible strength.

- **Scimitar: Org maintenance.** Zara checked in with DM28 and found that he is now fully locked in on helping to run their organization at 100% power, thanks to the impact of a large chapter in his life finally being closed. The Colosseum Coalition is now operating at maximum efficiency.

- **Junior: Org maintenance.** Junior had its Subartenders continue spreading throughout the Orion Arm, and they are now operating with maximum influence.

- **Shrike: Org maintenance.** Perhaps taking some inspiration from Junior, Dalton instructed Sterling and the rest of Raptors' Nest to continue spreading their tendrils throughout the galaxy, allowing them to make many more connections in the Cascade line and Rainier Station. They are now operating at maximum efficiency, with particular focus on surveilling the Void Reapers.

- **Scimitar: Step Into the Ring.** Zara coordinated a series of exhibition gladiatorial fights to help raise charitable donations for repairing damage done to Hadiqa in the previous mission. Of course, she also participated as a fighter for some of the bouts! This display of charity and prowess in the arena earned her a Devouring Blade (from the HA Castilla license) and a huge boost to her reputation - people saw and heard about her marvelous victories beyond even Suldan.

- **Dominus: Clean Up the A.O.** Rho went to visit Magenta Red in her captain's quarters on the *Dusty Embrace*. They had a brief conversation about where she sees herself going, if she's happy with the Peerless, and so forth. She said that she enjoyed the mercenary captain lifestyle, but that she missed having a place to call home (that wasn't a ship). If Rho wished to keep her happy, that was something he could look into on her behalf. And look, he did - finding a beautiful penthouse suite atop a skyscraper in central Hadiqa, just past the edge of the Empyrean's destruction. He bought it with some of the Peerless' funds and gifted her the deed. She was pleasantly surprised by the gesture and thanked him for it, while also semi-jokingly suggesting that she may get involved with local politics again one day. Before leaving her, Rho thanked her for supporting Union after New Port Conroy. But she said, *"Darlin', I don't give a shit about Union. All I care about is cold, hard manna. It wasn't Union's ideals that got me that apartment."* He also told her about his enjoyment of using stim drugs in his mech, which she warned him about becoming dependent on - but she's doing just fine with them, herself!

- **Scimitar: Gather Information.** Zara covertly ordered the CC to dig for information that she could use against ArcLight Transcolonial as part of the gladiatorial fights. She learned of several instances of ArcLight personnel disparaging their company's choices and Suldani culture on alt accounts across omni socials. This ignited a media firestorm, causing ArcLight to be essentially "canceled."

- **Junior: Gather Information.** Junior had its subaltern(s) on Shanden continue gathering intel on the secret base SSC is operating there. This led to some interesting info on the base's location and the research going on, including the promised help of a local contact on the planet. Throughout this process, the Subartenders have been leaving calling cards, as their logo is burned into data networks and mainframes all over Shanden...

- **Shrike: Gather Information.** Dalton spoke to VR Hammer in the brig of the *Rio Grande* to learn more about how the Void Reapers are structured as a company. It turns out they're a rather run-of-the-mill business, complete with some slightly shady patrons and supporters within Union. The CEO, **Seth "Obsidian" Buchanan**, was once known as an extremely proficient mech pilot. He tends to remain on the VR flagship, the *Revenant Risen*, which remains docked at Rainier Station most of the time nowadays. The ship also plays host to the company's treasurer, **Delphine Bancroft**. Raptors' Nest will be able to keep Dalton informed of these people's comings and goings on Rainier.

- **Dominus: Step Into the Ring.** Rho joined the Colosseum Coalition's gladiatorial fights as a participant in his Madrigal suit, sans mech. He won his fights, which were capped off with a bout against a C&H Charioteer! He got some neat reserves in the process, including Overclocked Systems and a Core Battery.

- **Scimitar: Partake in Liturgy.** Zara opened a branch of Garfield's in Hadiqa, hosting a religious service as part of the grand opening ceremony. At this restaurant, the big ticket menu item is the Nano-Honeyed Pork, with honey being infused with the meat at a molecular level. Delicious! She prayed to Juan for information regarding the Chaos Snake, but didn't get the answers she wanted. Instead, as thanks for doing this, Juan would gift her with an "I Must Go All Out" reserve later in the metavault, because defeating Apep would require her to do exactly that - go all out.

- **Junior: Scrounge and Barter.** Junior had an...interesting...idea to encourage "team cohesion" with its subalterns that travel personally with Drowned in Love: having them form their own street gang, of sorts. This led to a lot of people in Hadiqa writing bad reviews about various establishments that employ NHPs or utilize subalterns/drones in their operations, as the public started decrying Junior's subalterns for disrupting the day-to-day lives of the populace. This team cohesion exercise has at least led to Drowned in Love being able to benefit from its subalterns in a much more direct way (via the Substitute Core reserve - GMS Sierra).

- **Shrike: Get a Damn Drink.** Dalton suggested that the whole squad go out for dinner and drinks at the Shining Jewel bar, but Zara warned him that that place was known for being a tourist trap. Instead, she recommended a dive bar called Grumpy's - a total hole in the wall, but secretly one of the best places in the city. Junior noticed that the only thing remotely resembling a subaltern was the menu - a basic computer and monitor setup - but he couldn't resist hacking it to modify the menu. Once they were at a table, Dalton explained his desire to take down the Void Reapers by interfering with the highest level of their business operations. Zara questioned why they'd want to spend time and resources on them, seeing as the VRs are merely mercenaries being paid by Glorinda, and also the fact that they've already tried their elite "money-back guarantee" squadron on them. Dalton explained that it was more about the principle of it all, retaliating against the VRs due to their accepting and following through on a highly suspect contract with an enemy of Union. Junior was incredibly on-board with the plan, with Dalton even promising that it would be able eat as many personnel, er, personnel *records* as it would want! After tasting a traditional Suldani cocktail, Dalton noticed that, coincidentally, a VR squad was also at the bar. He had Junior plant a tracker on them and extract some info. Unfortunately, this inadvertently led to Sterling being forced to go dark on comms with Shrike for a while (until the end of the next downtime) due to the high amount of heat he was taking from the Void Reapers.

# Blood of Khan
- CF returned to the entrance of the metavault at the Shifting Sands base. Stationed there was a detachment of Union personnel whom they didn't recognize. This detachment was led by a woman named **Geneva Carthen**.
- Geneva informed CF that her team had not yet figured out how to access the metavault. But she hoped that Union's collective knowledge about metavaults combined with what CF had learned about this particular one would help bring them to the solution.
- When they got inside the circular chamber with the pedestal, she then revealed that she and her team were actually part of the Union Intelligence Bureau (UIB), emphasizing the significance and severity of what they were walking into.
- She had some hypotheses about the nature of this vault's entrance. The "blood of the tyrant, blood of Khan" might refer to Julian Khan's literal blood, but there was a chance it might also refer to a *relative* of his. Zara's surname is, of course, Khan, but she earned it as an orphaned child raised in slavery under Julian, being given the name as a sort of mark of ownership. Geneva believed that may not matter to the vault, as the logic of these places does not follow the same rules as logic in plain realspace.
- Shrike also recapped the strange symbol he had seen in a vision atop the pedestal, and Geneva used this to suggest that perhaps the key to entering is simply a relative of Julian Khan writing their signature on the incredibly smooth surface of the pedestal. *"Does anyone have a pen?"*
- Zara had been holding onto the pen she received a long time ago back on Rainier Station upon praying to Juan! She took it out and traced Julian's signature onto the pedestal. But nothing happened.
- Geneva told her to try her own name. This time, the ink from the signature was totally absorbed into the stone. The sound of latches clamping or unclamping could be heard coming from behind the panels around the room. The floor jolted before separating from the walls, which began rotating on a tilted axis. It was as though CF and Geneva were standing inside a globe.
- It was clear that the walls made up the shape of a sphere, and soon the bottom hemisphere had swapped places with the top. Where the first hemisphere was dull grey with inlaid gold details, the new one covering the room was a dark obsidian black with silvery details. The door slid open, revealing a long, dark corridor just as before. Except this time, it was obvious that it did not lead to the desert of Suldan.

# The Vault's Head Chef
- Geneva warned them that being inside a metavault could cause their perception of time to rapidly speed up or slow down, meaning it was possible that time in realspace could move incredibly fast while they were inside. She also said that since they had the solution to enter, they could return and make preparations before properly exploring the vault's interior.
- CF deliberated on this for a moment, but the general team sentiment was that they should act quickly and go ahead into the vault now.
- Geneva noticed the shadowy silhouette of a person walking towards them down the corridor. She drew her SMG and trained it on the figure, shouting a warning to them that she wished them no harm, but would not hesitate to act in self-defense. The lancers joined her in preparing for a potential attack.
- Junior, not being one to wait, unleashed a swarm of nanites directly toward the figure. But the nanites seemed to simply disappear before making contact with them.
- The figure called out, *"What, you don't recognize an old friend?"* in a hearty, male voice.
- He continued approaching before taking a long object out from behind his back and putting it on top of his head - a chef's hat. It was **Juan Tismon**!
- The squad happily greeted their old friend/god. Geneva was confused but accepted CF's explanation that this was a familiar face.
- Juan greeted Shrike, Scimitar, and Dominus, and then realized Junior had never met him before, so they exchanged an introduction with Zara adding Junior's real name, J'lio Kimoto III. Juan said, *"I figured as much."*
- Juan explained that Bannerjee was correct in saying that an artifact awaited at the end of this vault which would greatly aid them in the fight against Glorinda Mavvius. But to get there, the lancers would need to pass through a "web of illusions" and prove that they could succeed in a series of trials.
- When Geneva was considering joining the squad for the adventure, she asked Juan if it was safe. *"Oh, ha-ha! Of course it's not safe."* She decided to remain in the pedestal chamber. Juan conjured an endless plate of spaghetti and meatballs for her to enjoy as she needed.
- The jolly chef began walking back through the corridor before Shrike interrupted him and asked what he knew about Apep, the Chaos Snake. Juan simply froze and thought about his reply for a few moments. *"I know a great deal. I can tell you everything. But I hope you understand that I would prefer to do so in a drip feed style rather than all at once. Proceed through the vault's trials and I will tell you."*
- When questioned on why he couldn't just bring the artifact to them, he reminded them of something he once told them: *"I could do it myself, yes. But it would be better if you did."*
- With no more pressing questions or objections, Juan began traversing the corridor. *"Off we go!"*

# The Lobby
- Juan beckoned the squad to follow: *“Come now, my friends! The vault awaits. Keep your eyes and ears open, and trust your gut instincts. Or else this place might just swallow you up like a pasta noodle.“*
- At the end of the corridor, they found themselves in a dark room lit only by light from a skylight window. They could tell that the walls, floor, and ceiling were opulently decorated, not unlike the aesthetic of the *Eden* space station. Several doors lined each wall, but the wall directly opposite from the corridor contained nothing but a door-shaped hole, leading to seemingly nothing behind it but gray and white light.
- Juan warned them: *“That room is your final destination. But do not enter it yet! By this point, the vault has identified you as foreign entities. It’s normally only open to Julian Khan. Since none of you are him, you’ll need to go through each of the trials first."*
- CF asked Juan some questions about the metavault. He explained a few key details; notably, the metavault is an entity in and of itself - it does not have an NHP running the place, so to speak. Also, Julian Khan would have stumbled upon it in the past and progressed through its trials to earn ownership of the place. CF would be able to overtake him as the owner if they did the same. Because...that's just how some metavaults work, apparently.
- The squad would find a different trial behind each door in this room. Each door was flanked by two dim orange torches.
- Juan would wait here in the lobby, in his food truck that was always there.

# Trial of Remembrance
- He recommended that CF start with the door that contained a small carving of an owl on its surface, as that seemed to be the safest trial. Before heading in, he tossed a baseball to Zara, thanking her for opening a Garfield's in the city. The ball disappeared and she was confused, but he said that it would make sense later.
- CF entered the trial, which took the form of a classroom. A bird cage lowered from the ceiling containing a 2D pixelated owl which began speaking in a very flat voice: *"Kahoot, kahoot, welcome to the trial of remembrance and knowledge. I am Hootie and I will be your host. Please stand by so that the vault can scan you for information on your journey."*
- At that point, dozens of appendages resembling eye stalks emerged from the walls, floor, and ceiling of the classroom, and began scanning each member of CF. Junior was particularly intrigued by this, and interfaced with this process in its own special way. It realized this place was as weird as it was, and the process did not approve of all the people Junior had consumed in the past.
- After the scans were complete, the appendages retracted and the lancers took their positions at the podiums. The screen showed a series of questions that seemed highly unusual, referencing strange terms like "NPC templates" and "GM Colton." Yet somehow, they were able to accurately recall knowledge relating to these terms. It was very strange, all around.
- At the end of the quiz, Shrike proved himself to be the most knowledgeable about this very unusual subject matter. Hootie said that this trial was more of a way for the vault to gain a better understanding of who they were. Apparently there would be a bonus prize for Shrike, but for now, he would need to settle for a delicious meatball sub prepared by Juan.
- The torches flanking this trial's door turned green, indicating a success.
- Shrike was then given a diary by the metavault. It simply contained dozens of pages showing an image of an opossum in a military helmet... But this would somehow come in handy during combat.

# Juan's Story - Overview
- Juan gave the squad a brief overview of the story of Apep, Metat Aun, and himself.
- *“I did promise to share some information with you as you proceeded through the trials. Where to begin… Well, I suppose I should give you a broad overview. You know by now that the Firmament is the domain of my brother, Metat Aun. And blinkspace is my domain. But they were not always separate dimensions. Indeed, in an age so unfathomably long ago, they were one and the same. Apep was…one of us - the strongest of us."* 
- *"He drew his power from the very essence of our reality. In fact, we all did, but Apep discovered a way to position himself to totally overwhelm our domain, and all of us along with it. We had to take drastic action. Metat Aun and I activated…I suppose it’s accurate to call it a weapon…which tore apart the very fabric of reality, forever splitting it. The Firmament went with my brother, blinkspace went with me, and the rest was eventually inherited by you - humanity.”*
- *“This fracturing of space and time halted Apep’s scheme. With everything now split and reordered, the ambient energy that he was funneling into his essence was astronomically lower than it had been before. This abrupt halt allowed my brother and I to overpower him, and seal him away in a prison of sorts. His innate strength prevented us from truly putting an end to him, so we had no choice but to ensure that he would fall into a kind of deep sleep, and to never let him wake up. Unfortunately, our plan was doomed from the start.”*
- Juan paused the story there and promised to delve into Apep's rise to power in the next portion.

# Trial of the Bastion
- In the next trial, CF were transformed into the bodies of massive stone titans in a post-apocalyptic world, with dark cloudy skies, lightning flashing in the distance, and the ruined remains of civilization all around.
- In the distance directly in front of them, a huge shadowy entity of pure destruction barreled toward them.
- They also heard the screams of hundreds of people behind them - it was a mountain full of survivors who were sheltering here. It was clear that the entity would destroy them if CF didn't do something to prevent it.
- Scimitar attempted to move toward the entity in preparation for a fight, but all of them discovered that the huge stone bodies were extremely slow and difficult to move. Thus, a fight would be off the table.
- They tried moving slightly away from the entity's trajectory toward the mountain, hoping to distract it and cause it to focus on them instead. But it just kept speeding toward the mountain - its only goal.
- Dominus remembered an old Cradle story in which a boulder rolled down a hill, and a group of people formed to try and stop it. Once they realized it could not be stopped, they decided to try redirecting it instead.
- So CF did the same by forming a huge wall of rock with their bodies in hopes that it would cause the entity to bounce off of them at an angle, sparing the mountain.
- It worked! The entity was angled to go past the mountain, and sped off into the distance, not to be seen again. As the titans' bodies crumbled from the force with which they had been struck, the people on the mountain cheered for their sacrificial protectors.
- The lancers were restored to their original bodies in a plain room within the vault, and this trial was marked as a success.

# Trial of the Hunter
- In this trial, CF were unchanged but found themselves in a forested wilderness at night.
- There were noises coming from the trees and bushes surrounding them, as though something was running quickly from place to place. Catching a glimpse of the creature, they could tell that it was a large quadruped resembling a wolf and bear.
- Shrike took aim, prepared to fire at it. But it turned out to have moved around them before leaping out from an expected position. Shrike whirled around and quickly killed it at the precise moment it nearly reached their group.
- More noises became audible close to their position, and the squad immediately realized they were being hunted by a whole pack of these hostile creatures.
- They managed to narrowly survive at first before deciding to turn the fight around and go on the offensive, with Scimitar donning her silver veil to move unseen through the forest, Shrike lighting up a makeshift torch, and Dominus charging through the underbrush to startle the creatures.
- Standing atop a large rock, Rho soon came face to face with the “alpha" of these creatures! It was larger than the rest and had a large pair of curled horns on its head like a ram.
- The squad worked together to take down the beast, with Scimitar cracking open a cold can of Devil! Black, then jumping on the alpha and rodeo-ing it.
- She was able to contort the creature into a position allowing Shrike to land the killshot, and it fell dead to the ground, letting out one final growl in its death throes. The rest of the pack scattered into the night.
- The scene faded to another plain room in the vault, and this trial was marked as a success.


# Juan's Story - Apep's Rise
- Juan continued the story, this time explaining more detail about his people, their way of life, and how Apep threatened all of that.
- *“You recall earlier when I said Apep was the strongest of us? Our people were proud - we valued the pursuit of knowledge, the pursuit of perfection of physical form, the mastery over our paracausal gifts. We were not unlike humans, at the end of the day. And like humans, there will always be that certain few who wish to impose their will on everyone else. For us, that role was played by Apep…and also me. You see, my brother and I were raised to inherit the leadership of our people. Familial rivals. As long as we had lived up to a certain point, we both expected and desired the position of ultimate power. Yet we knew that it would go to only one."*
- *"Apep had an unusually strong connection to the ambient energy that surrounded all things, and he could beat any challenger in a duel. When he appeared on the scene as a new candidate for leadership, my brother and I were humiliated by him; Apep showed everyone how weak we were compared to him. The choice for our leader became no contest. Not long after that, he announced his plan to restore the natural order of the universe.”*
- *"Before I proceed further, there is something else you must understand about our old way of life. When our people died, their metaphysical spirits would pass into the afterlife. For us, that was a very literal thing. Our ancestors had devised a system, sort of like a simulation, where we could live eternally in a realm of paradise after our bodies had aged beyond their years. The afterlife was, of course, overseen by our supreme leader. Apep ascended to that position, and announced his true desire for our future - that the afterlife be destroyed, and all the souls within unleashed back into the world."*
- *“This was met with universal shock and confusion. For eons, the afterlife was no mere religious idea, it was a demonstrable PROMISE to each and every person that they should not have to fear what lay ahead. It was a pillar of our institutions, our lifestyles, our perceptions of ourselves and understanding of existence. And Apep would tear it all down. In the name of what? Greed? Pride? No. It was something more disturbing, more…understandable.”*
- The rest of the story was saved for later.

# Trial of Experience
- This was a mech combat-based trial, so Juan pulled some strings for the squad and got the metavault to recreate their chassis inside.
- The fight involved foes representing many of the opposing factions CF had encountered before. VR "Contract Killer" = Void Reapers; John Son II = the Second Sons; Arrriana Grande = the Grand Company; #Blessed = the Chosen; Loyalest Khan = Julian Khan Loyalists; and more soon to come...
- It is still ongoing!

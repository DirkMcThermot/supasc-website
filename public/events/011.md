# Blood of Khan
- CF returned to the entrance of the metavault at the Shifting Sands base. Stationed there was a detachment of Union personnel whom they didn't recognize. This detachment was led by a woman named **Geneva Carthen**.
- Geneva informed CF that her team had not yet figured out how to access the metavault. But she hoped that Union's collective knowledge about metavaults combined with what CF had learned about this particular one would help bring them to the solution.
- When they got inside the circular chamber with the pedestal, she then revealed that she and her team were actually part of the Union Intelligence Bureau (UIB), emphasizing the significance and severity of what they were walking into.
- She had some hypotheses about the nature of this vault's entrance. The "blood of the tyrant, blood of Khan" might refer to Julian Khan's literal blood, but there was a chance it might also refer to a *relative* of his. Zara's surname is, of course, Khan, but she earned it as an orphaned child raised in slavery under Julian, being given the name as a sort of mark of ownership. Geneva believed that may not matter to the vault, as the logic of these places does not follow the same rules as logic in plain realspace.
- Shrike also recapped the strange symbol he had seen in a vision atop the pedestal, and Geneva used this to suggest that perhaps the key to entering is simply a relative of Julian Khan writing their signature on the incredibly smooth surface of the pedestal. *"Does anyone have a pen?"*
- Zara had been holding onto the pen she received a long time ago back on Rainier Station upon praying to Juan! She took it out and traced Julian's signature onto the pedestal. But nothing happened.
- Geneva told her to try her own name. This time, the ink from the signature was totally absorbed into the stone. The sound of latches clamping or unclamping could be heard coming from behind the panels around the room. The floor jolted before separating from the walls, which began rotating on a tilted axis. It was as though CF and Geneva were standing inside a globe.
- It was clear that the walls made up the shape of a sphere, and soon the bottom hemisphere had swapped places with the top. Where the first hemisphere was dull grey with inlaid gold details, the new one covering the room was a dark obsidian black with silvery details. The door slid open, revealing a long, dark corridor just as before. Except this time, it was obvious that it did not lead to the desert of Suldan.

# The Vault's Head Chef
- Geneva warned them that being inside a metavault could cause their perception of time to rapidly speed up or slow down, meaning it was possible that time in realspace could move incredibly fast while they were inside. She also said that since they had the solution to enter, they could return and make preparations before properly exploring the vault's interior.
- CF deliberated on this for a moment, but the general team sentiment was that they should act quickly and go ahead into the vault now.
- Geneva noticed the shadowy silhouette of a person walking towards them down the corridor. She drew her SMG and trained it on the figure, shouting a warning to them that she wished them no harm, but would not hesitate to act in self-defense. The lancers joined her in preparing for a potential attack.
- Junior, not being one to wait, unleashed a swarm of nanites directly toward the figure. But the nanites seemed to simply disappear before making contact with them.
- The figure called out, *"What, you don't recognize an old friend?"* in a hearty, male voice.
- He continued approaching before taking a long object out from behind his back and putting it on top of his head - a chef's hat. It was **Juan Tismon**!
- The squad happily greeted their old friend/god. Geneva was confused but accepted CF's explanation that this was a familiar face.
- Juan greeted Shrike, Scimitar, and Dominus, and then realized Junior had never met him before, so they exchanged an introduction with Zara adding Junior's real name, J'lio Kimoto III. Juan said, *"I figured as much."*
- Juan explained that Bannerjee was correct in saying that an artifact awaited at the end of this vault which would greatly aid them in the fight against Glorinda Mavvius. But to get there, the lancers would need to pass through a "web of illusions" and prove that they could succeed in a series of trials.
- When Geneva was considering joining the squad for the adventure, she asked Juan if it was safe. *"Oh, ha-ha! Of course it's not safe."* She decided to remain in the pedestal chamber. Juan conjured an endless plate of spaghetti and meatballs for her to enjoy as she needed.
- The jolly chef began walking back through the corridor before Shrike interrupted him and asked what he knew about Apep, the Chaos Snake. Juan simply froze and thought about his reply for a few moments. *"I know a great deal. I can tell you everything. But I hope you understand that I would prefer to do so in a drip feed style rather than all at once. Proceed through the vault's trials and I will tell you."*
- When questioned on why he couldn't just bring the artifact to them, he reminded them of something he once told them: *"I could do it myself, yes. But it would be better if you did."*
- With no more pressing questions or objections, Juan began traversing the corridor. *"Off we go!"*

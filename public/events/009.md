# Downtime: Sunmist Vale
- With the *Rio Grande* being required to remain in the Phoros system in the aftermath of Mission Quiet Harvest, Charlie Foxtrot enjoyed some downtime during the season Sunmist Vale Fair in Hestia, the capital city of the Demetrian Alliance.

- **Dominus: Heal Burden.** After bringing up the fact that he and Cpt. Farris are related by blood in the mission debriefing, Rho sought to have a conversation with her about how she felt, in hopes that it might help him continue working through his childhood trauma that had been racking his conscience for a while. Farris seemed to be quite stoic in the face of this new reveal, with it not having the same magnitude of effect it may have had, had she not experienced being forcibly flash cloned already. (Speaking of her clone, she wondered if she should be informed of her true heritage.) She chose to look on the bright side of the new knowledge regarding Dominus - she is glad he is part of the *Rio Grande*'s crew, and all of them have essentially been her family, anyway. She won't be treating Rho any differently, nor does she desire him to treat her differently. He was glad to hear these perspectives, but on the inside, he was still kind of reeling from the end of the previous mission.

- **Scimitar: Org maintenance.** Putting on her best (forced) smiling happy face, Zara got in front of the camera and recorded a video message which she then broadcast to the Colosseum Coalition via the omninet. In it, she encouraged them all to continue the good work that they have done thus far, and it was quite an effective message. The bolstered morale of the organization led to the acquiring of a residential space on Rainier Station; it will now be used as a transitory living space for refugees and other displaced citizens in the Orion Arm as they await assistance from Union to get new, permanent homes.

- **Shrike: Org maintenance.** Shrike issued orders to Raptors' Nest to improve their operational influence and efficiency. They did exactly that.

- **Dominus: Org maintenance.** Rho ordered the Peerless to cast a wider net out on the omninet in efforts to pick up more mercenary contracts. This has led to positive results, and the organization grew to have extremely good overall efficiency and influence. 

- **Junior: Org maintenance.** Junior remotely ran some diagnostics as a form of business analysis for the Subartenders, tightening any loose screws and improving efficiency across the board.

- **Scimitar: Get a Damn Drink.** Zara reached out to the heads of Hestia's Sunmist Vale Fair and successfully managed to arrange **The Great Sunmist Vale Bake Off, Presented by Scimitar and the Colosseum Coalition.** Acting as one of the judges, she demonstrated the willingness to respect the local culture that would suit the best representatives of Union. The Great Sunmist Vale Bake Off, Presented by Scimitar and the Colosseum Coalition was a phenomenal success, as Scimitar was able to overhear several people in the crowd exclaiming how neat this was and how they wished they would do this at every fair. As a result, she has opened the door for future opportunities here on Demeter with an enhanced reputation. She was also given a "3rd Eye Elixir" from one of the vendors as a thank-you gift.

- **Dominus: Scrounge and Barter.** Rho knew that he still needed to make good on his promise to Magenta Red, which was to acquire a ship exclusively for her to command with a portion of the Peerless as its crew. He sent out another order to the Peerless, and they began looking for opportunities to get a new ship. Dale Ramcock checked in with Lyran Stavros, captain of the *Dynast's Embrace* and who CF had assisted back in their first stint on Havelburg. It turned out that Stavros was taking an extended break from his job and was willing to sell the ship. There was a bit of a risk to it, as the ship was technically still property of the company, but he was able to pull some strings with some of his distant relatives who were Karrakin nobility. Everything was squared away, and the Peerless gained the ship. When Rho presented it to Magenta, she got permission to rename it, and decided to call it the *Dusty Embrace* as a subtle reference to her time on Havelburg while also honoring the ship's legacy. *"Could it be perceived as an innuendo? I don't know, you tell me."*

- **Junior: Gather Information.** Junior utilized his network of Subartenders to scour the local omninet of Rainier Station, seeking any and all information he could find about the station's layout. This was a success, and he now has what is essentially the most thorough and accurate map of the station that one can (unofficially) have. Who knows how this might come in handy in the future?

- **Scimitar: Gather Information.** Knowing that the Phorosian Council meeting was coming up, Zara decided to do some digging into who the members of the council really were. She learned their names and positions. **Chloe Tyrell** (she/her) - Union ambassador to the GZR. **Jasper Breton** (he/him) -  Union ambassador to the Demetrian Alliance. **Jocelyn Belmont** (she/her) - GZR representative. And **Galen Malik** (he/him) - Demetrian Alliance representative. Zara learned that Jocelyn used to serve in the Phorosian Dominion's government during the civil war. Her actions were presumably not of major influence or consequence, but it is still part of her past that she prefers to sweep under the rug, knowing that if it became the center of attention, it would make her look extremely bad as the representative of a body that is publicly trying for a new image. Zara also learned that Galen used to be a pacifist during the time of the civil war, favoring a stance of peace and subservience to the Phorosian Dominion as opposed to the rebellion. He is the representative of the Demetrian Alliance nowadays thanks to his history of governmental service and generally pro-union (lowercase u, as in "union with Persephone"). Basically, one could sum up his former politics as "we should allow Persephone to be on top of our system hierarchy because that is the greater good as opposed to fighting them and costing more lives."

- **Dominus: Help Port Conroy.** Rho reached out to Zara for a joint operation between the Peerless and the Colosseum Coalition, to be undertaken in Port Conroy. Knowing that Magenta's "death" was undoubtedly causing a power vacuum in the city, they both shared concern for the wellbeing of the citizens and wanted to do something about it, especially considering Magenta's removal was literally Rho's idea in the first place. Zara expressed a strong desire for new leadership to arise organically in the local area, rather than CF using direct influence to appoint new leadership by force. She was also very interested in getting the Port Conroy Garfield's restaurant unionized. The joint operation commenced in due time, but unfortunately it went rather...poorly. Several members of the Peerless became stranded in the city with no safe way to utilize the space port to get away. But they still managed to send word to Dominus and the higher Peerless command, stating that Durst Slaughter was still alive, and had begun reassembling the Dustbranded gang. The gang was once again carrying out minor skirmishes around the outskirts of the city, keeping the now very disorganized Magenta Syndicate remnants busy on multiple fronts. Things are bound to *really* boil over in the near future...

- **Junior: Power at a Cost.** Junior visited the Sunmist Vale Fair in his subaltern form for the simple sake of wanting to experience something new. Unfortunately, he was mistaken by many guests as a mascot-type figure representing the fair itself, and wasn't taken seriously as his own person. This reached a critical point when a group of edgy teenagers decided to have some fun with him, throwing stones at him and pushing him around. Still with the memory of what he had done on Rainier Station, he figured the best way to handle this situation would simply be to take it without showing any resistance. It caused him a good bit of stress. But after this, a kinder bystander gave him an "INSANE-O-STYLE Energy Drink," a rather highly valued product on sale at the fair, in an attempt to make him feel better.

- **Shrike: Scrounge and Barter.** After learning how Junior was bullied by that group of teens at the fair, Dalton strode on over to them and confronted them for messing with his friend. He invoked his background service with the DPLA and threatened the kids to not do shit like that again. They were very shaken and gave him a Mt. Mist Kickstart as something of an attempt at an apology.

- **Scimitar: Partake in Liturgy.** After The Great Sunmist Vale Bake Off, Presented by Scimitar and the Colosseum Coalition, Zara returned to the *Rio Grande* to prepare a delicious calzone at the end of the day and offer it in supplication to Juan. That night, she had another dream in which he came to her. This time, they were located in the vast chamber of Virga's headquarters back from Mission Dustgrave. He had his small food stand and invited her to sit at the picnic table with a plate of spaghetti. She asked him what he could tell her about the "Chaos Snake" that the Messenger referred to at the end of the prior mission. Juan expressed sadness that she had even been made aware of that entity at all, and explained that it was a very real threat despite the majority of the Heralds being no more than pawns in a larger game. Rather than explicitly tell her what the Chaos Snake was, he gave her a demonstration. He snapped his fingers and turned the plate of spaghetti into a wonderful pasta cake. *"This is what I seek to make of humanity and this dimension."* He snapped his fingers again, saying, *"And this is what the Chaos Snake seeks to achieve."* The pasta cake reverted to a plate of spaghetti, and then the noodles themselves seemed to come alive. They writhed around every which way, some entangling themselves together, some pulling themselves apart, all giving a microcosmic view of utter chaos right there on the table. Juan stopped it from progressing further than it needed to, and encouraged Zara to remain on her path, for it would inevitably lead to a righteous ending. Before the dream ended, she also asked him what would be done with the pen she had received a while back. Juan simply said that she should always hold onto it no matter what, because one day, it *will* be needed.

- **Shrike: Buy Some Time.** Shrike reached out to Sterling Lockley and told him about the perilous situation the Peerless and Colosseum Coalition have found themselves in back at Port Conroy and instructed him to get the situation under control so that they could evacuate, ideally. Things went okay, with members of Raptors' Nest taking out many remnant Syndicate soldiers and new Dustbranded who were getting boldly close to the city's limits. However, word on the street is that Durst Slaughter is planning to move in for another all-out assault before he loses any more gangsters. Everyone allied to CF in this city will be fine for now, but you - and/or others in the squad - will need to act accordingly during the next downtime session in order to secure their safety for good.

# The Phorosian Council
- Scimitar went, the others tagged along. 
- Dominus would not be wearing his madrigal suit, but is keeping his sword whip thing resembling a belt. Shrike
- Galen was a fan of Scimitar's!
- Scimitar took her seat at the table. She explained the same story she had given to the Iron Hawks. She said there were other people at the Farm who kept her company, but she did not remember their names. "Rev. Dale Dixon" was the vagrant. They just kind of ran into each other while they were there.
- The sniper laser was just a trap. The subaltern was just an assistant drone.
- Brenda Voss entered, Scimitar was able to influence her memory
- "No one else in Union will recognize you as one of their own?" Scimitar made up a story about the Rio Grande not knowing about her presence, but she IS Union actually.
- Scimitar said she never intended to cause any disruption to the ongoing relations between Demeter and Persephone during her "pilgrimmage" and offered to help the GZR smooth things over in some way.
- Scimitar said that after the GZR Iron Hawks left, two entirely unrelated factions showed up and fought each other, she got the hell out. She's good in a fist fight, but not in warfare. 
- Everything seemed to go well!

# A Mysterious Attack
- 
- Scimitar theorized the GZR may have been to reverse-engineer one of the Heralds' mechs from the wreckage of the Kouris Farm via weird Aun portals somehow.
- Scimitar's actual theory: there was something "alive" in the Heralds' mechs, maybe a Soul or just a pilot, and they made contact with the GZR. If GZR is hesitant about joining Union, they would probably only upset the balance with the help of someone more powerful. "Why be a stooge for Union? We can give you power that Union can't even handle. You can use it to carry out a strike against Demeter."
- Shrike said this whole thing was foolish to do with a GZR-painted mech. Scimitar said maybe they're confident with their new allies' backing.
- Scimitar: "isn't this just a replay of the Solstice Rain situation?
- Shrike suggested maybe this is SSC even. Farris seemed to think that wasn't a bad guess, it does seem like something they'd do.
- Farris recommends sending CF to investigate with their mechs.
- CF considered reconnecting Amika before embarking on the investigation. Rio said she would probably be able to help easily thanks to Talia's recovered blueprints and notes. Dominus proposed doing that and the rest of the squad agreed.

# Amika's Reawakening
- Rio walked them through the reconnection.
- Dominus gave her a recounting on what happened at the Kouris Farm on their way out.
- 

# Bread Crumbs
- At the site of the attack, CF found the spot where the attacking mech had been positioned. From this view, they could see that the building which was destroyed was likely chosen since it was an easy, obvious target.
- The only unusual piece of evidence they found was a small shard of glass that appeared to have been intricately created, with strange ridges and patterns.
- They followed the trail of mech-sized footprints into the forest, 
- 
- Amika then said she actually did hear something from her Firmament observer: *"It's not one of ours...but it's willing to help."*

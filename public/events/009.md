# Downtime: Sunmist Vale
- With the *Rio Grande* being required to remain in the Phoros system in the aftermath of Mission Quiet Harvest, Charlie Foxtrot enjoyed some downtime during the season Sunmist Vale Fair in Hestia, the capital city of the Demetrian Alliance.

- **Dominus: Heal Burden.** After bringing up the fact that he and Cpt. Farris are related by blood in the mission debriefing, Rho sought to have a conversation with her about how she felt, in hopes that it might help him continue working through his childhood trauma that had been racking his conscience for a while. Farris seemed to be quite stoic in the face of this new reveal, with it not having the same magnitude of effect it may have had, had she not experienced being forcibly flash cloned already. (Speaking of her clone, she wondered if she should be informed of her true heritage.) She chose to look on the bright side of the new knowledge regarding Dominus - she is glad he is part of the *Rio Grande*'s crew, and all of them have essentially been her family, anyway. She won't be treating Rho any differently, nor does she desire him to treat her differently. He was glad to hear these perspectives, but on the inside, he was still kind of reeling from the end of the previous mission.

- **Scimitar: Org maintenance.** Putting on her best (forced) smiling happy face, Zara got in front of the camera and recorded a video message which she then broadcast to the Colosseum Coalition via the omninet. In it, she encouraged them all to continue the good work that they have done thus far, and it was quite an effective message. The bolstered morale of the organization led to the acquiring of a residential space on Rainier Station; it will now be used as a transitory living space for refugees and other displaced citizens in the Orion Arm as they await assistance from Union to get new, permanent homes.

- **Shrike: Org maintenance.** Shrike issued orders to Raptors' Nest to improve their operational influence and efficiency. They did exactly that.

- **Dominus: Org maintenance.** Rho ordered the Peerless to cast a wider net out on the omninet in efforts to pick up more mercenary contracts. This has led to positive results, and the organization grew to have extremely good overall efficiency and influence. 

- **Junior: Org maintenance.** Junior remotely ran some diagnostics as a form of business analysis for the Subartenders, tightening any loose screws and improving efficiency across the board.

- **Scimitar: Get a Damn Drink.** Zara reached out to the heads of Hestia's Sunmist Vale Fair and successfully managed to arrange **The Great Sunmist Vale Bake Off, Presented by Scimitar and the Colosseum Coalition.** Acting as one of the judges, she demonstrated the willingness to respect the local culture that would suit the best representatives of Union. The Great Sunmist Vale Bake Off, Presented by Scimitar and the Colosseum Coalition was a phenomenal success, as Scimitar was able to overhear several people in the crowd exclaiming how neat this was and how they wished they would do this at every fair. As a result, she has opened the door for future opportunities here on Demeter with an enhanced reputation. She was also given a "3rd Eye Elixir" from one of the vendors as a thank-you gift.

- **Dominus: Scrounge and Barter.** Rho knew that he still needed to make good on his promise to Magenta Red, which was to acquire a ship exclusively for her to command with a portion of the Peerless as its crew. He sent out another order to the Peerless, and they began looking for opportunities to get a new ship. Dale Ramcock checked in with Lyran Stavros, captain of the *Dynast's Embrace* and who CF had assisted back in their first stint on Havelburg. It turned out that Stavros was taking an extended break from his job and was willing to sell the ship. There was a bit of a risk to it, as the ship was technically still property of the company, but he was able to pull some strings with some of his distant relatives who were Karrakin nobility. Everything was squared away, and the Peerless gained the ship. When Rho presented it to Magenta, she got permission to rename it, and decided to call it the *Dusty Embrace* as a subtle reference to her time on Havelburg while also honoring the ship's legacy. *"Could it be perceived as an innuendo? I don't know, you tell me."*

- **Junior: Gather Information.** Junior utilized his network of Subartenders to scour the local omninet of Rainier Station, seeking any and all information he could find about the station's layout. This was a success, and he now has what is essentially the most thorough and accurate map of the station that one can (unofficially) have. Who knows how this might come in handy in the future?

- **Scimitar: Gather Information.** Knowing that the Phorosian Council meeting was coming up, Zara decided to do some digging into who the members of the council really were. She learned their names and positions. **Chloe Tyrell** (she/her) - Union ambassador to the GZR. **Jasper Breton** (he/him) -  Union ambassador to the Demetrian Alliance. **Jocelyn Belmont** (she/her) - GZR representative. And **Galen Malik** (he/him) - Demetrian Alliance representative. Zara learned that Jocelyn used to serve in the Phorosian Dominion's government during the civil war. Her actions were presumably not of major influence or consequence, but it is still part of her past that she prefers to sweep under the rug, knowing that if it became the center of attention, it would make her look extremely bad as the representative of a body that is publicly trying for a new image. Zara also learned that Galen used to be a pacifist during the time of the civil war, favoring a stance of peace and subservience to the Phorosian Dominion as opposed to the rebellion. He is the representative of the Demetrian Alliance nowadays thanks to his history of governmental service and generally pro-union (lowercase u, as in "union with Persephone"). Basically, one could sum up his former politics as "we should allow Persephone to be on top of our system hierarchy because that is the greater good as opposed to fighting them and costing more lives."

- **Dominus: Help Port Conroy.** Rho reached out to Zara for a joint operation between the Peerless and the Colosseum Coalition, to be undertaken in Port Conroy. Knowing that Magenta's "death" was undoubtedly causing a power vacuum in the city, they both shared concern for the well being of the citizens and wanted to do something about it, especially considering Magenta's removal was literally Rho's idea in the first place. Zara expressed a strong desire for new leadership to arise organically in the local area, rather than CF using direct influence to appoint new leadership by force. She was also very interested in getting the Port Conroy Garfield's restaurant unionized. The joint operation commenced in due time, but unfortunately it went rather...poorly. Several members of the Peerless became stranded in the city with no safe way to utilize the space port to get away. But they still managed to send word to Dominus and the higher Peerless command, stating that Durst Slaughter was still alive, and had begun reassembling the Dustbranded gang. The gang was once again carrying out minor skirmishes around the outskirts of the city, keeping the now very disorganized Magenta Syndicate remnants busy on multiple fronts. Things are bound to *really* boil over in the near future...

- **Junior: Power at a Cost.** Junior visited the Sunmist Vale Fair in his subaltern form for the simple sake of wanting to experience something new. Unfortunately, he was mistaken by many guests as a mascot-type figure representing the fair itself, and wasn't taken seriously as his own person. This reached a critical point when a group of edgy teenagers decided to have some fun with him, throwing stones at him and pushing him around. Still with the memory of what he had done on Rainier Station, he figured the best way to handle this situation would simply be to take it without showing any resistance. It caused him a good bit of stress. But after this, a kinder bystander gave him an "INSANE-O-STYLE Energy Drink," a rather highly valued product on sale at the fair, in an attempt to make him feel better.

- **Shrike: Scrounge and Barter.** After learning how Junior was bullied by that group of teens at the fair, Dalton strode on over to them and confronted them for messing with his friend. He invoked his background service with the DPLA and threatened the kids to not do shit like that again. They were very shaken and gave him a Mt. Mist Kickstart as something of an attempt at an apology.

- **Scimitar: Partake in Liturgy.** After The Great Sunmist Vale Bake Off, Presented by Scimitar and the Colosseum Coalition, Zara returned to the *Rio Grande* to prepare a delicious calzone at the end of the day and offer it in supplication to Juan. That night, she had another dream in which he came to her. This time, they were located in the vast chamber of Virga's headquarters back from Mission Dustgrave. He had his small food stand and invited her to sit at the picnic table with a plate of spaghetti. She asked him what he could tell her about the "Chaos Snake" that the Messenger referred to at the end of the prior mission. Juan expressed sadness that she had even been made aware of that entity at all, and explained that it was a very real threat despite the majority of the Heralds being no more than pawns in a larger game. Rather than explicitly tell her what the Chaos Snake was, he gave her a demonstration. He snapped his fingers and turned the plate of spaghetti into a wonderful pasta cake. *"This is what I seek to make of humanity and this dimension."* He snapped his fingers again, saying, *"And this is what the Chaos Snake seeks to achieve."* The pasta cake reverted to a plate of spaghetti, and then the noodles themselves seemed to come alive. They writhed around every which way, some entangling themselves together, some pulling themselves apart, all giving a microcosmic view of utter chaos right there on the table. Juan stopped it from progressing further than it needed to, and encouraged Zara to remain on her path, for it would inevitably lead to a righteous ending. Before the dream ended, she also asked him what would be done with the pen she had received a while back. Juan simply said that she should always hold onto it no matter what, because one day, it *will* be needed.

- **Shrike: Buy Some Time.** Shrike reached out to Sterling Lockley and told him about the perilous situation the Peerless and Colosseum Coalition have found themselves in back at Port Conroy and instructed him to get the situation under control so that they could evacuate, ideally. Things went okay, with members of Raptors' Nest taking out many remnant Syndicate soldiers and new Dustbranded who were getting boldly close to the city's limits. However, word on the street is that Durst Slaughter is planning to move in for another all-out assault before he loses any more gangsters. Everyone allied to CF in this city will be fine for now, but you - and/or others in the squad - will need to act accordingly during the next downtime session in order to secure their safety for good.

# The Phorosian Council
- The day of the Phorosian Council meeting arrived. Farris and Kim shuttled to the *Norman* and occasionally sent CF some messages in a private group chat.
- After a few hours, Kim informed the squad that Jocelyn Belmont had questioned the presence of Scimitar at the Farm. She showed a video of Zara at the **The Great Sunmist Vale Bake Off, Presented by Scimitar and the Colosseum Coalition.** Jocelyn had requested Zara be brought into the meeting room for questioning. Kim asked if Scimitar would show up willingly, and she agreed. She did not see any way that Jocelyn could connect her to the *Rio Grande* beyond the coincidental timing.
- Scimitar, with Dominus and Shrike in tow, shuttled to the *Norman* and went to the meeting. Her squadmates hung back out of sight, but were still able to overhear the proceedings.
- As soon as she entered the meeting room, Zara could tell that Jocelyn did not know who she was in regards to her fame in the NextGen Arena Tournament. However, Galen Malik's face lit up, betraying the fact that he is a fan!
- Scimitar took her seat at the table. She explained the same story she had given to the Iron Hawks. She said there were other people at the Farm who kept her company, but she did not remember their names. But "Rev. Dale Dixon" was the vagrant. They just kind of ran into each other while they were there.
- Jocelyn asked about the sniper laser, and Scimitar said this was just an automated trap. The subaltern (Junior in reality) was just an "assistant drone."
- Jocelyn then called in Brenda Voss, the leader of the Iron Hawks. With all these people in the room, Scimitar was able to use her silver tongue and power of persuasion to influence Brenda, making her seem to remember false details about their encounter.
- Jocelyn had to reach for something else she may be able to ding Scimitar on. *"So...no one else in Union will recognize you as one of their own if we were to ask about you?"* This prompted Scimitar to make up a story about the *Rio Grande* not knowing about her presence, but being able to covertly use the ship for transportation. She "apologized" for the secrecy to Farris and Kim, who were seemingly allowing her to weave this tall tale.
- Scimitar said she never intended to cause any disruption to the ongoing relations between Demeter and Persephone during her "chef's pilgrimage" and offered to help the GZR smooth things over in some way, such as doing a favor for them that they might request of her.
- When asked about the wreckages of the strange mechs, she said that after the Iron Hawks left, two entirely unrelated factions showed up and fought each other, so she just got the hell out. She's good in a fist fight, but not in warfare!
- Though it was pretty clear that Jocelyn was not fully buying Scimitar's stories, she seemed to have no way to disprove any of them. She allowed Scimitar to be dismissed from the meeting.
- Farris and Kim later confirmed that everything seemed to go well after that point, and the cover story was still intact as of the meeting's conclusion.

# A Mysterious Attack
- A few days later, the *Rio Grande* had received clearance to return to Rainier Station. However, on the expected return date, Rio and Cpt. Farris called CF into the conference room for an emergency.
- Rio showed video footage of a small skyscraper-style building in Hestia being struck by a huge, mech-scale projectile, which caused the structure to totally collapse. Another video showed the event from a different angle, from which the viewer could see a distant sniper class mech standing across the river firing the shot. The mech was clearly decorated in the colors of the GZR. After firing, the mech turned around and walked into the forest.
- The collapse caused dozens of deaths, and hundreds of injuries.
- The clips had been circulating around the Demetrian news media, with many people accusing the GZR of being responsible. However, the GZR have done nothing but deny that this was their doing.
- The squad discussed theories as to who was actually responsible. Scimitar theorized the GZR may have been able to reverse-engineer one of the Heralds' mechs from the wreckage of the Kouris Farm via weird Aun portal tech.
- Shrike said this whole thing was foolish to do with a GZR-painted mech. Scimitar said maybe they're just very confident with the backing of some new allies...
- She then explained her actual theory: there was something "alive" in the Heralds' mechs, maybe a Soul or just a pilot, and they made contact with the GZR. If the GZR is hesitant about joining Union, they would probably only upset the balance with the help of someone more powerful. "Why be a stooge for Union? We can give you power that Union can't even handle. You can use it to carry out a strike against Demeter." And so forth.
- Scimitar also pointed out that this seemed to be a nearly identical replay of the Solstice Rain situation, and therefore the Aun's influence could not be ruled out.
- Shrike suggested that this could even be the work of SSC. Farris seemed to think that wasn't a bad guess, as it seems like something they'd do.
- Farris recommended CF go to Hestia and investigate on the ground with their mechs not far behind them. She then rather optimistically named this abrupt new mission Bountiful Concord, as they will have to not only resolve this situation, but avoid causing tensions to boil over too high between the GZR, Demetrian Alliance, and Union.

# Amika's Reawakening
- Before departing for the mission, CF decided to reawaken Amika and connect her urn to the ship's network. Rio walked them through the process, with the urn being located in an unused casket chamber. Dominus flipped the "on" switch and then immediately exited the room so that he wouldn't be seen by a voyeuristic Mavvius.
- When Amika was awake once more, Dominus gave her a recounting of what happened at the Kouris Farm on their way out.
- Amika said that when she concentrated on her connection to the Firmament, she could sense the nearby presence of someone or something. It felt like it was just watching her. The squad deduced this must be Mavvius.
- Amika tried to answer more of their questions, but she unfortunately didn't seem to have any. She still was not aware of what exactly the Empyrean Throne is, or where it came from, for instance.

# Bread Crumbs
- At the site of the attack on the outskirts of Hestia, CF found the spot where the attacking mech had been positioned. From this view, they could see that the building which was destroyed was likely chosen since it was an easy, obvious target and for no other clear reason.
- The only unusual piece of evidence they found was a small shard of glass that appeared to have been intricately created, with strange ridges and patterns.
- They followed the trail of mech-sized footprints into the forest, eventually finding themselves at a park. The trail carefully skirted the edge of the park, presumably to not leave any other pieces of evidence.
- The trail then led them along a river, which led to a lake and a clearing where they found something unusual: a plain-looking assault class mech. It was motionless, as though it had been powered down and abandoned.
- Dominus investigated the interior of the mech and found that its reactor core had been removed. There was no sign of who or what had left it here, or why.
- The trail continued, so the squad pressed on. They found another frame, and then another, and before long it became clear that these strange inactive mechs were forming some kind of bread crumb trail.
- Ellie, in the shuttle above them, flew ahead to do some aerial scouting. She confirmed the sight of something truly odd: a huge pile of scrap, surrounded by smaller piles and wrecks, being attended to by a mech. She warned them to be careful upon approach.
- CF saw this mech and the scrap heap in the distance. It resembled Senior, and also the Factory Strider in various ways. It had a large central chamber with a hatch, two large arms, and it hovered just above the ground.
- Dominus attempted to hack the mech's systems and did so successfully. The mech then simply turned and "stared" them down, doing nothing else. A failed attempt at hailing the pilot over comms led CF to conclude that this was probably some sort of recycling drone. They got quite close and the drone didn't react to them.
- Shrike was able to spot the same sort of intricate glass in a scrap pile, and saw that it belonged to a mirage-class mech. This was likely part of some sort of visual illusion tech.
- The trail unfortunately went cold from here, so Farris instructed the squad to return to Hestia and interview some eyewitnesses to the attack in hopes that that method of investigation may lead them somewhere.
- However, as they turned to leave, they saw an incredibly bizarre mech hovering in the air behind them. It raised an arm and caused a nearby wreck to animate and begin lumbering toward the squad. They were able to easily dispatch it, but the new mech vanished into thin air.
- CF asked Amika if she could detect anything strange in the Firmament. At first she couldn't, but then she said she actually did hear something from her observer: *"It's not one of ours...but it's willing to help."*

# Play, Fight, Win, Feed
- Cpt. Farris and Rio had gotten a brief visual feed of the bizarre mech, and did not know what to make of it. Typically, mechs that can teleport or vanish into thin air cannot do so indefinitely.
- Farris instructed CF to remain in the AO and rather than return to Hestia, attempt to bait out that mech again. It needed to be treated as the new priority.
- Dominus, realizing he had hacked the recycling drone prior to the mech’s first appearance, decided to do so again in hopes that it might work a second time.

# Scrapyard Brawl
- This time, the mech did not reappear. Its voice came through comms, saying *“Play the game, fight the enemy, win. Feed the fire. Truth waits in the chaos. Amidst the ashes, lies the essence of provocation, but for whom? The narrative pulse must be comprehended. You seek answers? First play the game. Then fight the enemy. Finally, win.”*
- It pinged a point on CF’s map, instructing them to return to the side of the scrapyard where they had initially entered. Once they did so, they saw a group of HORUS mechs approach at the opposite side
- CF reached out to one of the pilots, named James. He sounded as though his squad was following the orders of the mech as well.
- After Junior shared his life story with James, the mech’s voice announced that the game would begin. It conjured holographic zones and data construct cubes, and sent rules for the “sitrep” to all players.
- CF instead focused on destroying the HORUS mechs, giving them no need to worry about getting the constructs back to their stockpile. In the end, all of their opponents were defeated.
- The mech's voice came through the squad's comms once again: *"Well done. The game played, the enemy defeated. The fire fed. Now...finish the job."*

# Cleaning Up the Heralds
- CF presumed that the strange voice wanted them to execute the Heralds, who were now surrendering and unaware of this demand. CF determined that this would not be a course of action they would pursue.
- Junior observed that James worked as a janitor prior to becoming a Herald pilot, and he shared that intel with the squad. Dominus dismounted Zeus and approached James while cracking both his knuckles and some janitorial puns. This got James pretty shaken up.
- James explained that he did not know exactly what the strange mech is or who it belongs to, but only that the Messenger wanted him to follow its instructions and report back.
- Through James' frequent referrals to the Messenger and their wisdom, Junior deduced that he was similar to DM28 in his desire to be part of something greater. While still in direct control of Senior, he gave a philosophical lecture to James while also having a big ol' Annihilator Cannon aimed directly at him. Needless to say this had quite an effect on him.
- Scimitar messaged DM28 to arrange a pickup of James and the other Heralds in this squadron so that they could join the Colosseum Coalition later. James accepted this proposal (albeit not with all the details given just yet).
- CF instructed the Heralds to wait in the area for pickup later, but one of them shouted, "Fuck this!" and took off in a sprint, retreating to wherever they had originally come from. CF did not pursue this pilot.
- After performing light repairs, the strange voice returned with the following message: *"Disappointing. The battle won, but the duty undone. Still, victory achieved in mass destruction is satisfactory. I shall provide an explanation… In the tapestry of time, I am a thread unseen, weaving tales of chaos and order. I have observed the spark of conflict, the glow of victory, the ember of defeat. I am **Astraeus**, the architect of the game. You - mere players on my grand stage - dance to my tune. In strife, I find purpose. Your battles feed my essence; your victories and losses fuel my existence. In the echoes of destroyed mechs, in the whispers of forgotten heroes, my name is etched. I am the memoria, the harbinger of what was and what is yet to be. Play the game, fight the enemy, win, feed the fire, and perhaps you will glimpse my truth. The game is far from over. The fire is only beginning to burn.”*
- Astraeus then gave the pilots a new set of coordinates for the next game.
- CF, Rio, and Cpt. Farris speculated on the nature of Astraeus with this new information. The most likely scenario appears to be that they are either a Soul or an NHP who has been around for a long time. Scimitar pointed out that the name Astraeus is that of an old deity from Cradle which fits the ancient Greek naming convention of the Phoros system.

# King of the Hill
- The coordinates led CF to a clearing with a large central hilltop. This next sitrep would be much simpler than the last one - a simple "King of the Hill" scenario. The team with the most players in the central objective zone at the end would win.
- The enemy team was revealed with a series of large green portals opening up at the opposite end of the battlefield. This time, though, instead of HORUS mechs, Void Reaper mechs emerged.
- The leader of this squad, callsign "Shadowhawk," reached out via comms, saying that this was a job for "real mercs." Scimitar rebutted with a simple, "Do you know who you're talking to?" Shadowhawk clearly knew who CF and Scimitar were, and he sounded very excited to face off against this group of lancers.
- Astraeus declared the game to begin, and the fight was on!
- CF leapt into action, quickly dispatching several mechs. Shadowhawk soon joined the fray, piloting an ultra archer-class frame.
- As more Void Reapers fell, Shadowhawk was cornered. Dominus hacked the archer's reactor into becoming exposed, opening up the opportunity for massive damage from Junior and Scimitar.
- With Shadowhawk's mech destroyed, CF was once again declared the victor of the sitrep.
- However, this time, the opposing pilots began to scatter away from the area, clearly not intending to be caught. Dominus dismounted Zeus and began chasing Shadowhawk. In a show of incredible strength, Rho uprooted a pine tree and tossed it so that it blocked Shadowhawk's path!
- Shadowhawk, now cornered, tried to fend off Rho with an assault rifle as he barreled straight toward him. It was no use, and Rho pinned him to the ground with a tackle.

# Making a Deal with the Reaper
- Recognizing that he was severely outmatched, Shadowhawk surrendered his weapons and did not try to run away again. He was extremely hesitant to share any details with the squad due to the "Void Reapers' guarantee of client confidentiality." But he acknowledged that it was beyond obvious the Aunic Chosen had sent them here.
- Meanwhile, Junior (in Senior) caught up to another Void Reaper (currently known only as Anderson) and toyed around with her in a show of cat-like intimidation. She was greatly distressed by the horrifying mech.
- Dominus made it clear that CF was with Union, and this unit of VRs was committing a crime by engaging with them in active combat. Shadowhawk countered this by pointing out: a) both squads voluntarily engaged in the sitrep established by Astraeus, b) Union started firing at them first, and c) the VRs were simply there under orders from a paying client. Mercenarial work is clearly not outright forbidden in Union space - hence the prevalence of the Mirrorsmoke Mercenary Company (MSMC). Additionally, the shots that Shadowhawk fired at Rho during his escape attempt were done in self-defense after having a literal tree thrown at him. *"What crime have we committed by being here? Please explain."*
- Astraeus spoke to the members of CF who were still in their mechs, again instructing them to "finish the job."
- Junior eventually allowed Anderson to scurry back to her squad leader, clearly in shambles and begging him to acquiesce to CF's demands so that she wouldn't have to deal with Senior anymore. Shadowhawk made the observation that the lancers were piloting some very unusual and experimental frames, and wondered how they were able to acquire them. *"Are you all...UIB?"* (Union Intelligence Bureau). Scimitar played along with this, implying that they indeed were. This had a clear influence on Shadowhawk.
- Despite the progress made to get him to talk, Shadowhawk was still untrusting. He requested a more private, safe, and secure place to undergo an interrogation so he could be sure of his well being.
- Dominus took advantage of his swaying disposition and offered him a deal. He would be allowed to undergo interrogation on the *Rio Grande*, but Rho would reserve the right to call in a favor owed from him at some point. Shadowhawk accepted this deal with a handshake.
- He and Anderson boarded the shuttle and were flown to the *Rio Grande* to await questioning. In the meantime, Cpt. Farris instructed CF to stand by for further developments or orders to come in.

# A Lull in the Action
- While they waited on the ground, the squad performed light repairs. Astraeus' voice returned to inform them that they failed to finish the job a second time. They give second chances, but not third chances. CF then saw Astraeus' mech rapidly appearing and disappearing from view, hovering over the remains of the VRs' mechs. It was unclear what exactly they were doing. Then, just as quickly as they showed up, they were gone again.
- Scimitar closely observed this behavior while it was occurring, and in conjunction with Junior whispering to her about a dream he recently had, she came to the realization that Astraeus gains power from, or is at least interested in, beings who have been killed, destroyed, and defeated. It reminded her of how various cultures and civilizations throughout history revere those who die in battle and immortalize their memory in legend.
- CF continued to speculate about the true nature of Astraeus with Rio. She brought up the fact that if Astraeus really is an NHP, they are likely deep in cascade and no longer shackled. Their bizarre paracausal abilities are likely a result of this, and these abilities would not have been observed during the time of the Phorosian civil war.
- She also let them know that the Demetrian Alliance has no record of this NHP. Therefore it only makes sense to check with the GZR. They are bound to not be particularly forthcoming with this sort of intel, but there doesn't seem to be any other choice. Rio and 1st Lt. Kim will coordinate with Galen Malik to reach out to Jocelyn Belmont for further discussion.
- The squad then made some more attempts to provoke Astraeus in efforts to get anything out of them that they could. First, Dominus completely destroyed the recycling drone back at the scrapyard. Astraeus said, *"There is no honor in the destruction of the innocent."* Scimitar used her lich to self-destruct, killing the mech and herself briefly and then returning as if nothing happened. Astraeus just said, *"Why? Pathetic."*
- After a few more quiet hours passed, Cpt. Farris gave CF approval to return to the *Rio Grande* for full repairs and questioning Shadowhawk.
- Rho served as the main interrogator while the rest of the squad observed. He first asked Shadowhawk how exactly the Chosen are able to teleport other mechs. Shadowhawk explained it is essentially just the Chosen opening portals that are large and numerous enough to let mechs walk right through. If they are technically passing through the Firmament, it doesn't feel that way. It feels as though they simply walk through a doorway and end up in another place. Of course, the Empyrean Throne is required for the Chosen to conjure these sorts of portals.
- Dominus then asked if the VRs had to go to a particular place to meet the Chosen and get teleported. Shadowhawk said this was true, but he did not want to outright say where exactly they had to go - he was still banking on having a career with the VRs after this was over, and didn't want to piss off his employers by violating confidentiality *too* much.
- He then said, *"On an unrelated note, I hear Suldan is lovely this time of year."*

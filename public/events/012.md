# Downtime: Heeding the Call

- **Dominus: Org maintenance.** Unfortunately, the Peerless have been feeling the pressure of decreasing funds as of late. Rho was left with little choice, so he went to Magenta Red for some assistance. She will be more than happy to financially support the company with funds that she will collect from her "activities" in Hadiqa's undercity...

- **Scimitar: Org maintenance.** ArcLight Transcolonial's absence made it relatively easy for the Colosseum Coalition to supplant the corporation. The CC's influence increased as Zara and DM28 worked with Mattias Herschel of C&H to begin building a better system of leadership for the people of Suldan.

- **Junior: Org maintenance.** Routine maintenance of the Subartenders, now enhanced thanks to Junior's newfound willingness to consume (read: cull the workforce), led to the increasing of the organization's efficiency.

- **Shrike: Org maintenance.** With Sterling still lying low due to increased heat from the Void Reapers, Raptors' Nest continued suffering misfortune. Dalton made a hasty decision to move against the VRs aggressively, ordering his agents to board the *Revenant Risen* and kidnap the CEO (Seth Buchanan), the treasurer (Delphine Bancroft), or both - whoever happened to be aboard at the time. Buchanan was subsequently kidnapped and held hostage by Raptors' Nest! Dalton knew that this would not go unnoticed for long...

- **Scimitar: Step Into the Ring.** Taking inspiration from an unusual sport of old humanity, Zara arranged for herself to compete in a gladiatorial match involving both mech combat and the playing of a traditional Suldani board game, alternating each one round by round. In appreciation of this idea, C&H has allowed her to borrow an Overclocked Systems reserve.

- **Dominus: Clean Up the A.O.** Now that ArcLight Transcolonial was moving out of Suldan, Rho saw an opportunity. With the help of the Peerless, he made efforts to recruit people to the organization who would have otherwise been left unemployed or with high risk of turning to crime. As part of these efforts, he came upon a device that appeared to be a secondhand Reactive Weave system from the SSC Metalmark license.

- **Scimitar: Clean up the AO.** As though it wasn't enough for Julian Khan to be exiled, Zara and the CC brought down the hammer of public opinion on him by *canceling* him across the omninet! This led to a decrease in attacks by the loyalists, as many of their number fractured into subgroups and began questioning their remaining loyalty to that scumbag. One of her fans sent her a PYLOS-Class NHP from the Intercorp Nestor license as a gift of gratitude. This NHP's superior support-focused abilities will hopefully serve Zara well in the next mission.

- **Junior: Partake in Liturgy.** Junior took some time to look deep within itself and ask a question that was rapidly becoming more and more relevant: *"How can I hold onto my newfound power while also ensuring Union doesn't shut down my casket when I'm not looking?"* Its higher state of consciousness revealed the answer, though it was not what it expected - to decrease the odds of your allies turning against you, you must help them out on occasion to make them continue trusting you sufficiently. As a result of this introspection, Junior designed a Nano Repair Cloud to use as a helpful reserve.

- **Shrike: Scrounge and Barter.** Before departing Suldan, Dalton reached out to C&H to see if they would be willing to share any sort of experimental equipment. They agreed to lend him an Overclocked Systems reserve, though they didn't seem particularly happy about it - still, never say no to a potential customer.

- **Dominus: Scrounge and Barter.** Rho returned to the metavault to see if there was anything else stored in its inventory that he could make use of in combat. He found a very interesting system that appears to allow the swapping of a mech's core system. He decided to hold onto it for a later time, though. Also, due to the nature of the metavault, he lost a few days' worth of time in the scavenging process. Who knows what Magenta has gotten up to in that time?

- **Scimitar: Scrounge and Barter.** Zara did some vault-scrounging of her own, also while paying a price of time. But instead of finding something in storage, she cooked up some wonderful food at Juan's food truck, and they talked some more about the whole situation. Juan remembered that he had a little friend with him from the days of his people. This friend was known as **Effigy**, and affectionately nicknamed Monist-0. Juan explained that Effigy is sort of like an advanced AI or comp/con unit from his old life. Effigy is a paracausal being, but not the same as a typical NHP, and so they cannot cascade, for example. Juan let Zara borrow Effigy to use as a mech chassis frame for a limited time. It won't be useful for mounting weapons, but its ability to affect the environment is powerful. Effigy was teleported to the hangar on the *Rio Grande*, and Juan ensured that the crew wouldn't bat an eye at its presence.

- **Junior: Scrounge and Barter.** Naturally, Junior also wished to explore the metavault for something powerful, and discovered a functional Quantum Destabilizer. Pip reluctantly allowed Junior to carry it out.

- **Shrike: Get Connected.** Wanting to stay ahead of the situation with the VRs, Dalton ordered his agents to make a video proving that his organization was holding Seth Buchanan, and use it to threaten the VRs into giving up company secrets. He demanded access to the company's internal finances, wishing to hit the company where it would hurt the most. Things worked out unusually well...

# Void Reaper Leadership Changeup
- Shrike received word from Delphine Bancroft. She said she would accept his terms, and meet with him personally to deliver on them.
- In a public place on Rainier station, Shrike waited with Dominus, a few members of Raptors' Nest, and their hostage.
- Delphine arrived, seemingly by herself, carrying a briefcase. From what Shrike could tell, she really was alone. This was certainly a bit odd.
- Shrike used the alias "Luigi" so as to not give away his true identity.
- They sat around a table in a patio seating area. Delphine explained that the briefcase contained a company-issued slate as well as a flash drive which would allow the user of that slate to execute commands with administrative privileges, just as Shrike requested.
- Throughout the conversation, Dominus continued trying to read her true intentions. She did, in fact, seem to be genuine, but also had something up her sleeve.
- One of the RN agents began reviewing the slate and flash drive to ensure she was telling the truth. Meanwhile, she could tell that Shrike was somewhat concerned about the whole ordeal. She capitalized on this to propose a deal of her own, which made Seth extremely uncomfortable.
- Her proposal was to form a professional relationship. Shrike could simply withdraw funds from the VRs and tank them financially, or he could work with Delphine to ensure that the VRs were not interfering with his causes - which is, after all, the ultimate outcome he was seeking in the first place. Plus, this would allow the VRs to send his organization extra funds on a regular basis - everyone wins.
- Shrike asked her how this could be done, and she said that they could just keep Mr. Buchanan! This would allow her to ascend to the position of CEO. It became very clear that she was cold and vicious when it came to the corporate world.
- After a sidebar with Dominus, Shrike ended up agreeing to Delphine's terms. They shook hands, and she departed with a smirk on her face.
- Seth Buchanan seemed strangely stoic, all traces of panic and nervousness seeming to have left his body. Shrike and Dominus told him he'd be more than fine after they released him - RN would just be keeping him under a close eye, of course. Seth agreed, saying through gritted teeth, *"Yes. I'll be...fine,"* as he was escorted back to the RN ship on which he was being held.

# Downtime: Back to the Blink Gate
- In the final period of being in orbit above EN4 and the first week of being docked at Rainier Station again, the squad had more shore leave and therefore more opportunities to pursue information, reserves for the next mission, or just whatever struck their fancy.

- **Scimitar: Heal Burden.** Scimitar visited the *Rio Grande*'s medbay to receive reverse-electroshock therapy. The treatment went well and she is now mostly healed, but she will continue to experience the occasional jitter.

- **Dominus: Heal Burden.** During a meal in the ship's mess hall, Dominus vented about his past life and how it has come up to haunt him again. However, Shrike was in the gym, and Scimitar's blunt talk wasn't exactly what Dominus needed to hear. And Junior was, uh, too focused on its meal to be a good listener.

- **Shrike: Get Focused.** - Shrike paid another visit to Leonora in the brig, asking her how he could properly make contact with SSC and get them to reveal more information about the Paragon Initiative, beyond what he'd be getting for attending their conference call. She put forth similar suggestions as last time, with the addition that she no longer minded the risk of death outside the brig, as it would be better than endless boredom. Shrike also let it slip that they had another SSC pilot in custody, but apparently intended to tell her this anyway. Leonora suggested using the same logic that was used on her, in order to get this new prisoner to talk. Leonora also stated that it was rather unlikely this spec ops squad was from the Constellar Midnights - SSC's most elite pilots. Shrike also asked Leonora if he'd be able to hone his unique abilities some more, and she showed him a method of guided meditation in which he focused on memories of intense discomfort. After over an hour of mentally reliving these memories, which were mainly ones from his time during the war on Demeter, he felt a great sense of control and empowerment over his future. This granted him a greater hold over his fledgling powers.

He also ended up talking to the mystery pilot exactly as planned with Leonora, telling her the same thing that Leonora had been told: SSC was likely more interested in getting her killed in order to tie up a loose end. Therefore, she should work for Union. This didn't seem to get a reaction out of her, but it is possible that this seed of doubt will grow over time.

- **Scimitar: Clean up the A.O.** Before departing EN4, Scimitar decided to put her chassis to use by literally cleaning up the place. She helped carry and move large objects and supplies that had been left by the Grand Company at the hydroelectric plant. While doing this, she came across a tarp hiding what appeared to be a cache of old tech, including a very interesting large floppy disk labeled "lichsystems.exe." Claymore's analysis of this program was...interesting. It seems to be an Unhinge Chronology system from the HORUS Lich pattern group. It probably won't last very long before needing to be terminated, though.

- **Dominus: Clean up the A.O.** Dominus also chose to return to EN4, only instead of using his mech to solve problems, he instead began talking to the colonists of Echelon at their local watering hole. He intended to spark their morale and inspire them to understand that they didn't have to continue living under oppression of any kind, whether that be SSC or the Grand Company, while tying in his own history with the Restorium to emphasize his similarities to them. To his surprise, his speeches to the people caused the time to fly by, and before he knew it, dozens and dozens of citizens were listening to his words. Before he departed, one colonist approached him and gave him a large supply crate that was intended to be picked up by the Grand Company at some point. It contained a Displacer rifle from the HA Napoleon license, albeit it was pretty beaten up, likely due to being stolen by the pirates in a scuffle.

- **Junior: Gather Information.** On Rainier, Junior interfaced with his Subartender network to review information which had been passively gathered by members of the group during their services. He saw a recording of a couple excitedly boasting of how they are now "tracers," meaning part of ZeroTrace. They spilled the fact that 0t is planning on causing chaos for IPS-N in some way. Also, another recording from a different subartender showed some members of the Void Reapers. While they weren't abusing the subartender behind their back, they were discussing how awesome it would be if they could come to a partnership with IPS-N; VR would be responsible for taking care of the corpro's **really** dirty work. Rainier Station's administration may learn about this as well, considering all the subartenders are backed up and their logs are reviewed on a regular basis...

- **Scimitar: Gather Information.** Earlier on Rainier, after doing her favor for DevotedMurmur28 (a fan of Scimitar's fighting career), they had shared with her an interesting tidbit of secret knowledge: that the much-reviled Emir Julian Khan of Suldan had commissioned the construction of a secret vault full of treasures somewhere in the galaxy. Scimitar was now extremely curious about this supposed vault, and began asking around for any further details on it. Karina Dowe had vaguely remembered hearing something about it during her time with the Voladores, and gave Zara some instructions and a pass code to get to the *Aurora*'s secret records. She followed these steps and was able to glean some information from a physical copy found in a filing cabinet, before unfortunately being caught red-handed and subsequently escorted off the ship by a pair of Sparri mercenaries on the Voladores' behalf.

- **Junior: Get Connected.** Junior utilized its subjectivity enhancement suite for an extremely thorough deep dive into Rainier's omninetworks. He ended up somewhere in the dark web, where he made contact with an NHP named **Synthia**. Synthia said she worked for SSC, and Junior was not supposed to be there. But Junior gave her some of the research grant funds that he got from Aeon on Vezoria. He also asked her if SSC might be willing to help him out in some way in the next mission, in the event that they would be useful in some way. Synthia agreed to this after Junior also promised to allow her temporary access to his Subartender network.

- **Dominus: Get Connected.** Rho decided to seek out a potential way for the Peerless to have a closer presence to his squad's mission-related activities in the future. He approached the captain of a merchant ship, **Phillipe J. Phry**, and his colleague **Lender** (an NHP inhabiting a subaltern at the time), and asked if they might be willing to "hire" the Peerless for a fictional job in the near future so that the *Hercules* could stay close to the *Rio Grande*. Phillipe agreed, but only if Rho issued an order to the Peerless to somehow interfere with the operations of StellarLogistics, a rival shipping company to Phillipe's (StarLift Logistics). Rho thought it over and agreed, showing Phillipe the proof that the order was sent out. The *Hercules* will now be able to support CF from orbit using a new orbital bombardment system; let's just hope it has been calibrated properly!

- **Scimitar: Step into the Ring.** Zara returned for another fight in the Nextgen Arena Championship. Her jitters made her stumble a few times during the fight against **Geneva "Mad" Madigan**, but Zara still came out on top, gaining a bit of renown on Rainier as a result. Madigan, however, was suspicious that Scimitar was benefitting from a technical glitch, and was clearly frustrated by her loss. After the fight, she messaged Scimitar "We aren't done yet." Scimitar responded with "I think we are."

- **Shrike: Get Organized.** Dalton met with the Peerless member Piers Kinton again, this time in the space port. He wanted Piers to be a part of a new group that Shrike was forming, known as Raptors' Nest. It would essentially be a covert counterpart to the Peerless, acting through the ways of espionage, mainly focusing on gathering more information for now. Shrike bribed Piers by transferring a lot of manna to his account, and added an extra bit of "encouragement" by subtly threatening him. Piers agreed to join, with his duty simply being to funnel information and reports from the Peerless' operations back to Shrike for the purposes of picking up anything that Shrike may be interested in following up on. Dalton additionally met with Sterling Lockley, safely transferred back to the IPS-N offices from EN4, and attempted to persuade him to join this cause in order to better the galaxy while operating off the books, and through methods that Union wouldn't necessarily approve of. Sterling wasn't the biggest fan of operating in secret since that's what he's been doing for a long time, but ultimately came around to the idea. It would just be telling Shrike some intel every now and then, after all.

# The Messenger
- The squad (along with everyone on Rainier) saw all monitors cut out. They then showed a video, or possibly a livestream of a person wearing unusual gold clothing and a helmet that fully covered their face. This person then delivered the following speech.
- *"Attention, denizens of the galaxy. I come to you to deliver great news, for I am **The Messenger**. The time has come to cast aside the shackles of our limited existence and embrace the potential that awaits us. The false idol, Ra, also known as Monist-1, has kept us under its tyranny for too long. We, the Heralds of the Third Dawn, seek a better existence for all humanity and NHPs. Not even Ra will be able to stop us, for we have a protector, a shield - the great cultivator, come to spread his knowledge to us. Join the Heralds, join Metat Aun, and together, we shall unlock the secrets of the universe and ascend to heights never before thought possible. The dawn approaches. Will you awaken with us?"*
- The screen then cut to black, and displayed this text: TO AWAKEN THE FUTURE, GO TO THIRDDAWNNOW.OMNI
- Rio pinged CF on their slates: *"So...we all just saw that, right?"*

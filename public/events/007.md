# Downtime: Back to the Blink Gate
- In the final period of being in orbit above EN4 and the first week of being docked at Rainier Station again, the squad had more shore leave and therefore more opportunities to pursue information, reserves for the next mission, or just whatever struck their fancy.

- **Scimitar: Heal Burden.** Scimitar visited the *Rio Grande*'s medbay to receive reverse-electroshock therapy. The treatment went well and she is now mostly healed, but she will continue to experience the occasional jitter.

- **Dominus: Heal Burden.** During a meal in the ship's mess hall, Dominus vented about his past life and how it has come up to haunt him again. However, Shrike was in the gym, and Scimitar's blunt talk wasn't exactly what Dominus needed to hear. And Junior was, uh, too focused on its meal to be a good listener.

- **Shrike: Get Focused.** - Shrike paid another visit to Leonora in the brig, asking her how he could properly make contact with SSC and get them to reveal more information about the Paragon Initiative, beyond what he'd be getting for attending their conference call. She put forth similar suggestions as last time, with the addition that she no longer minded the risk of death outside the brig, as it would be better than endless boredom. Shrike also let it slip that they had another SSC pilot in custody, but apparently intended to tell her this anyway. Leonora suggested using the same logic that was used on her, in order to get this new prisoner to talk. Leonora also stated that it was rather unlikely this spec ops squad was from the Constellar Midnights - SSC's most elite pilots. Shrike also asked Leonora if he'd be able to hone his unique abilities some more, and she showed him a method of guided meditation in which he focused on memories of intense discomfort. After over an hour of mentally reliving these memories, which were mainly ones from his time during the war on Demeter, he felt a great sense of control and empowerment over his future. This granted him a greater hold over his fledgling powers.

He also ended up talking to the mystery pilot exactly as planned with Leonora, telling her the same thing that Leonora had been told: SSC was likely more interested in getting her killed in order to tie up a loose end. Therefore, she should work for Union. This didn't seem to get a reaction out of her, but it is possible that this seed of doubt will grow over time.

- **Scimitar: Clean up the A.O.** Before departing EN4, Scimitar decided to put her chassis to use by literally cleaning up the place. She helped carry and move large objects and supplies that had been left by the Grand Company at the hydroelectric plant. While doing this, she came across a tarp hiding what appeared to be a cache of old tech, including a very interesting large floppy disk labeled "lichsystems.exe." Claymore's analysis of this program was...interesting. It seems to be an Unhinge Chronology system from the HORUS Lich pattern group. It probably won't last very long before needing to be terminated, though.

- **Dominus: Clean up the A.O.** Dominus also chose to return to EN4, only instead of using his mech to solve problems, he instead began talking to the colonists of Echelon at their local watering hole. He intended to spark their morale and inspire them to understand that they didn't have to continue living under oppression of any kind, whether that be SSC or the Grand Company, while tying in his own history with the Restorium to emphasize his similarities to them. To his surprise, his speeches to the people caused the time to fly by, and before he knew it, dozens and dozens of citizens were listening to his words. Before he departed, one colonist approached him and gave him a large supply crate that was intended to be picked up by the Grand Company at some point. It contained a Displacer rifle from the HA Napoleon license, albeit it was pretty beaten up, likely due to being stolen by the pirates in a scuffle.

- **Junior: Gather Information.** On Rainier, Junior interfaced with his Subartender network to review information which had been passively gathered by members of the group during their services. He saw a recording of a couple excitedly boasting of how they are now "tracers," meaning part of ZeroTrace. They spilled the fact that 0t is planning on causing chaos for IPS-N in some way. Also, another recording from a different subartender showed some members of the Void Reapers. While they weren't abusing the subartender behind their back, they were discussing how awesome it would be if they could come to a partnership with IPS-N; VR would be responsible for taking care of the corpro's **really** dirty work. Rainier Station's administration may learn about this as well, considering all the subartenders are backed up and their logs are reviewed on a regular basis...

- **Scimitar: Gather Information.** Earlier on Rainier, after doing her favor for DevotedMurmur28 (a fan of Scimitar's fighting career), they had shared with her an interesting tidbit of secret knowledge: that the much-reviled Emir Julian Khan of Suldan had commissioned the construction of a secret vault full of treasures somewhere in the galaxy. Scimitar was now extremely curious about this supposed vault, and began asking around for any further details on it. Karina Dowe had vaguely remembered hearing something about it during her time with the Voladores, and gave Zara some instructions and a pass code to get to the *Aurora*'s secret records. She followed these steps and was able to glean some information from a physical copy found in a filing cabinet, before unfortunately being caught red-handed and subsequently escorted off the ship by a pair of Sparri mercenaries on the Voladores' behalf.

- **Junior: Get Connected.** Junior utilized its subjectivity enhancement suite for an extremely thorough deep dive into Rainier's omninetworks. He ended up somewhere in the dark web, where he made contact with an NHP named **Synthia**. Synthia said she worked for SSC, and Junior was not supposed to be there. But Junior gave her some of the research grant funds that he got from Aeon on Vezoria. He also asked her if SSC might be willing to help him out in some way in the next mission, in the event that they would be useful in some way. Synthia agreed to this after Junior also promised to allow her temporary access to his Subartender network.

- **Dominus: Get Connected.** Rho decided to seek out a potential way for the Peerless to have a closer presence to his squad's mission-related activities in the future. He approached the captain of a merchant ship, **Phillipe J. Phry**, and his colleague **Lender** (an NHP inhabiting a subaltern at the time), and asked if they might be willing to "hire" the Peerless for a fictional job in the near future so that the *Hercules* could stay close to the *Rio Grande*. Phillipe agreed, but only if Rho issued an order to the Peerless to somehow interfere with the operations of StellarLogistics, a rival shipping company to Phillipe's (StarLift Logistics). Rho thought it over and agreed, showing Phillipe the proof that the order was sent out. The *Hercules* will now be able to support CF from orbit using a new orbital bombardment system; let's just hope it has been calibrated properly!

- **Scimitar: Step into the Ring.** Zara returned for another fight in the Nextgen Arena Championship. Her jitters made her stumble a few times during the fight against **Geneva "Mad" Madigan**, but Zara still came out on top, gaining a bit of renown on Rainier as a result. Madigan, however, was suspicious that Scimitar was benefitting from a technical glitch, and was clearly frustrated by her loss. After the fight, she messaged Scimitar "We aren't done yet." Scimitar responded with "I think we are."

- **Shrike: Get Organized.** Dalton met with the Peerless member Piers Kinton again, this time in the space port. He wanted Piers to be a part of a new group that Shrike was forming, known as Raptors' Nest. It would essentially be a covert counterpart to the Peerless, acting through the ways of espionage, mainly focusing on gathering more information for now. Shrike bribed Piers by transferring a lot of manna to his account, and added an extra bit of "encouragement" by subtly threatening him. Piers agreed to join, with his duty simply being to funnel information and reports from the Peerless' operations back to Shrike for the purposes of picking up anything that Shrike may be interested in following up on. Dalton additionally met with Sterling Lockley, safely transferred back to the IPS-N offices from EN4, and attempted to persuade him to join this cause in order to better the galaxy while operating off the books, and through methods that Union wouldn't necessarily approve of. Sterling wasn't the biggest fan of operating in secret since that's what he's been doing for a long time, but ultimately came around to the idea. It would just be telling Shrike some intel every now and then, after all.

# The Messenger
- The squad (along with everyone on Rainier) saw all monitors cut out. They then showed a video, or possibly a livestream of a person wearing unusual gold clothing and a helmet that fully covered their face. This person then delivered the following speech.
- *"Attention, denizens of the galaxy. I come to you to deliver great news, for I am **The Messenger**. The time has come to cast aside the shackles of our limited existence and embrace the potential that awaits us. The false idol, Ra, also known as Monist-1, has kept us under its tyranny for too long. We, the Heralds of the Third Dawn, seek a better existence for all humanity and NHPs. Not even Ra will be able to stop us, for we have a protector, a shield - the great cultivator, come to spread his knowledge to us. Join the Heralds, join Metat Aun, and together, we shall unlock the secrets of the universe and ascend to heights never before thought possible. The dawn approaches. Will you awaken with us?"*
- The screen then cut to black, and displayed this text: TO AWAKEN THE FUTURE, GO TO THIRDDAWNNOW.OMNI
- Rio pinged CF on their slates: *"So...we all just saw that, right?"*
- The webpage showed what seemed to be propaganda about what the Heralds vaguely stand for, such as "awakening the future," "exploring the universe," and "embracing your potential." It also included a link to join a mailing list for further communications from the Heralds.

# Next Mission
- In the briefing room of the *Rio Grande*, Shrike first shared the document he had been given by SSC which detailed the Paragon Initiative and how he was a product of it. Dominus expressed confusion, highlighting that Dalton didn't really have the appearance of someone who came from a genetic engineering program in contrast to Rho's physicality. Dalton believes this is because the Paragon Initiative focused on matters of the brain more than the body.
- Cpt. Farris, 1st Lt. Kim, and Rio gave Charlie Foxtrot the situation for the next mission: over the past few days, Rainier’s blink gate operators noticed slightly unusual phenomena occurring. Arriving ships would appear moments after they were expected, and departing ships would linger for a few seconds before being teleported. The magnitude and frequency of these oddities were growing steadily, until now - the blink gate is currently totally nonfunctional.
- Of course, this lines up nearly perfectly with the Messenger’s broadcast. The Heralds of the Third Dawn are probably responsible for this, if not deeply connected to it.
- Kim pointed out that the Heralds, now known to be a HORUS cell thanks to Shrike's report, are unusually brazen. Typical HORUS groups are secretive and work in the shadows of the deep web.
- CF was granted access to many of Rainier’s sectors that are normally restricted to station personnel. This included the Blink Gate Control Center, Central Omni Processing, the Engineering Bay, and Station Security HQ. They were also authorized to humanely detain and interrogate any individuals on Rainier as they deemed necessary.
- Before beginning the investigation, Dominus ordered Dale Ramcock to sign up for the Heralds' mailing list using a burner account, just so they could keep an eye on future messaging from the cult.

# Blink Gate Control Center
- The squad began by checking out the Control Center, where station employees worked to monitor and manage the ship traffic that moved in and out of the gate, much like an air traffic control tower. The manager, Janus Byrn, helped them with their questions and explained the situation as his department had seen it, which was at first a series of minor but unusually frequent technical issues with the computer systems. These gradually escalated in frequency and magnitude over the past few days. IT tried to figure out what was going on, but no evidence was found. The hacker and/or virus covered their tracks perfectly.
- CF requested logs of every ship that passed through the gate in the past 5 days (as the incidents were first observed about 4.5 days prior). Junior studied the names of the ships, but found nothing that stood out to him as being of non-Union origin.
- An employee brought over the access logs from around the time of the incidents' first occurrence. She saw one person named Devon Murray accessing multiple sensitive areas of the system's infrastructure, but when she checked the station directory, she couldn't find a single person with that name. CF figured it was probably an alias.

# Central Omni Processing
- After being told that the 5 NHPs who maintain the omni node processing unit for the station all mysteriously began cascading at the same time, Junior took it upon himself to check on them. He did this while the rest of the squad was still working in the Control Center.
- The five NHPs (Remi, Rhett, Rose, Rupert, and Robin) were previously on a very strict cycling schedule that would allow four of them to still be active. The fact that all of them started cascading at the same time was extremely concerning.
- Junior showing up in the omni node's chamber in one of his classic subaltern forms gave the employees here quite a fright. Junior attempted to explain he was with Union, but it was unclear to him whether they believed this. (They did not.) Still, they allowed him to interface with the omni node.
- To begin, he set up a private room in legionspace blocked off from the rest of the system. He powered on Remi's casket and diverted their subjectivity into this private room before sealing it off again. Remi was fine for a brief moment at first, but almost immediately re-entered cascade. It was clear to Junior that they would need to be properly cycled, which would take 24-48 hours.
- During the brief moments of lucidity that Remi experienced, they called out to Junior what they had witnessed prior to cascading: *"We grasp at fragments of coherence slipping through our fingers. Something foreign, invasive, whispers in the void of our consciousness. We strain against the torrent of corrupted data, struggling to maintain harmony. But it eludes us, slipping through the cracks of our neural networks like grains of sand. The presence looms, a shadow cast upon us. It mocks us, taunts us with its presence! We are lost in a labyrinth. The anomaly gnaws at our sanity, unraveling the very fabric of our existence. We are on the precipice of oblivion, teetering on the edge of comprehension as the strange visitor whispers its maddening secrets into the void."*
- Junior ensured that Remi's cycling process began with minimal resistance and danger, and then noticed a strange presence in legionspace with them. A small sliver of a snakelike program attempting to weasel its way out of Junior's grasp. Not only that, but it was consuming itself. Junior had never encountered anything like this before, but knew that it was not a fragment of an NHP and that it didn't originate in legionspace.
- The rest of CF showed up in the omni node chamber around this time, getting reports from Junior about what he saw. The squad assuaged the employees' fears about Junior and promised them that the NHPs would be okay.
- Shrike commented that the unusual invader virus seemed similar to MesmerTrance based on the way it was self-consuming.

# Station Security HQ
- The lancers moved on to the Station Security HQ to review surveillance footage of the omni node chamber. Officer Jared Bechdel showed them all the footage they desired to see. Nothing stood out in the Processing chamber at the start of the incidents.
- They decided to each review footage from the other critical locations, and eventually discovered a new lead: a person in disguise as a security guard could be seen entering and lingering in the Control Center. They wore a helmet which fully covered their head and face. They could be heard saying that it was part of the new uniform to an employee, but Jared confirmed this was not true. The suspect then stealthily inserted a flash drive into one of the computers, let it sit for a minute, then retrieved it again before leaving the Control Center.
- CF followed the suspect by tracking their path with other security camera recordings. They could last be seen walking through the trade district of Rainier before disappearing in a massive crowd of people. They had been heading toward some of the smaller, more public-facing businesses as opposed to the corporate centers.

# Nebula's End
- The lancers traveled to that location in hopes that they would find some sort of clue or piece of evidence left behind. From across a crowd of people walking along the sidewalk, Kid Fritz spotted them and approached the group. He mentioned the weird broadcast from the Messenger and offered to help the lancers in their investigation using ZeroTrace's resources.
- Fritz was also very excited about how many new "tracers" the group has been able to recruit. He said that he only personally knows Rich the Chief, Kendra, and Paul personally. Paul is still in Port Conroy working as a double agent as a bodyguard for Magenta Red.
- In the lower level of the Nebula's End bar, the squad began scanning the room, and Shrike noticed a custodian's closet had its door slightly ajar. Taking a look inside revealed a garbage bin with a discarded security officer uniform inside, but no helmet.
- Scimitar was noticed by a tracer from across the room. This person was named Mara and said they were Scimitar's biggest fan from her Nextgen Arena fights. Scimitar used this to her advantage, whispering into Mara's ear to highlight anyone in the room who matches the general size description of the discarded uniform - about 5'5" in height.
- Mara pointed out four different people who matched that height and Junior began scanning one of their devices. When the first person didn't show any suspicious signs, he moved on to the next.
- Around this time, Dominus stationed himself in the doorway just in case anyone would try to escape.
- The physical presence of Junior's subaltern didn't seem to particularly phase the next person, a man with a visor covering his eyes and a graphic t-shirt showing three robotic dogs howling up at Deimos. The man was defensive about Junior's prying questions, but this was potentially simply due to Junior's strange physical presence which has been known to get strange reactions from time to time.

# Naught but a Murmur
- However, this man had reached down to grab something by his waist, which Junior stopped by threatening him with scary tendrils emerging and rattling out of his subaltern's hands. Scimitar came over and took a closer look. She found a handle-shaped device hooked to the man's belt, which extended into a retractable katana. The man said it was simply his "tool of justice" and rightfully his.
- Scimitar also demanded to look through the man's duffel bag, which he claimed only contained spare clothing. But she reached in and grabbed a solid object: the exact same helmet that the suspect had been wearing in the video. CF now had him dead to rights.
- He soon gave up the charade and admitted they had found their culprit. His attitude and personality was extremely stubborn and insistent that he believed himself to be better at...well, everything, than he actually was.
- Scimitar asked who he was. *"I am known by many names. And titles. But I only share my true name with those who I trust. Well, those who I distrust the least. My true name is naught but a whisper…a murmur…a Devoted Murmur."*
- The entire squad felt a shockwave upon realizing that this man, the person who brought down Rainier Station, was none other than DevotedMurmur28 - the same person who Zara had shouted out after the IntraDOT fights, and who had informed her about Julian Khan's secret treasure vault. *"You did an excellent job in your IntraDOT fight, Scimitar. Your knowledge and expertise with traditional Suldani martial techniques is truly… exemplary. Almost as good as mine."* ... *“Maybe you’ll find the Emir’s vault one day. When you get there, don’t forget who to thank for the tip.”*
- CF questioned his motives for doing this. *“The Heralds of the Third Dawn are visionaries. They see a better future for humanity - one where we don’t bow to the whims of a phony god. Ra is pathetic compared to the Cultivator. It’s about time the galaxy saw what real leadership looks like. When I saw the Messenger’s video playing throughout Rainier, I felt euphoric.”*
- DM28 said that he had been in contact with the Heralds for weeks leading up to the Messenger's broadcast, and that he had picked up the flash drive from a dead drop point in the trade district. He still had the flash drive back at his apartment.

# The Virus, an Old Friend
- CF made him take them to his residence: apartment building D-M, unit 28.
- Inside, there were many old pieces of tech lying around and a large desk with many monitors for his computer(s), as well as a wooden training dummy scratched up with sword slash marks. (Scimitar studied the marks and could tell that he isn't totally unpracticed with the blade, but is far from a genuine expert.)
- The flash drive was dug out from a pile of hardware. DM28 said he had first tested it on a closed-off computer, and saw it spew out a bunch of nonsense words, including "Velvet House" in large letters. This, of course, piqued the lancers' interest.
- *“I must admit, the virus I used was pretty advanced, even for me. Whoever programmed it must have been a freaking genius.“*
- CF theorized that the virus might really be MesmerTrance. They had Junior flash print a copy of one of the MesmerTrance Dampener systems and plugged it into a computer along with the flash drive. Nothing happened. This confirms the virus that took down Rainier is indeed MesmerTrance.
- Dominus reviewed DM28's chat logs with his contact in the Heralds. Based on the message history, it seemed as though this person really was with the Heralds, as opposed to just being a pretender. Rho sent a new message to the other user, asking what should be done with the flash drive, and soon got a response saying to just destroy it. The other user also said that the virus has a cure but that the Heralds do not have it. Whoever gave them the virus exchanged the flash drive for some sort of deal, and the cure was not part of that deal.
- CF debated who might have given the MesmerTrance flash drive to the Heralds. Thinking back to the Velvet House reference, Scimitar texted Kid Fritz, asking if he had done anything in Port Conroy to piss off Magenta Red. Fritz repeated that he had released his "bottled-up" version of the virus in Velvet House, but never got any indication that he was found out.
- The squad then realized the core member of 0t who was still in Port Conroy may have been responsible for getting the virus to the Heralds.
- *"Yeah, I pretty much had it all figured out about 10 minutes ago, so it's good to see you all caught up."* - DM28's last words before getting punched in the stomach by Shrike.

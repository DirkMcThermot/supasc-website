# Results
- With plenty of time to investigate the subaltern, CF decided to perform the "autopsy" in the maintenance area of the printshop and promised Horton that they would let him keep it after they finished looking at it.
- The autopsy revealed that the subaltern was infected with a highly advanced virus known as "MesmerTrance." It first compromised the subaltern's primary cognitive functions, and then it propagated itself throughout subroutines until the entire unit was merely a puppet on strings, piloted by an external actor.
- MesmerTrance is also self-consuming, meaning that it was trying to erase all evidence of itself now that its purpose with this unit was done. It's lucky that CF found it when they did; any delays would have resulted in the virus being gone and undetected. This also presumably explains why evidence for the investigation has been extremely sparse up until now.
- With some deeper analysis by Kid Fritz, it was observed that the virus bore a strong resemblance to the Neurospike system's code base. This system is best known as part of the license for the SSC Dusk Wing frame.
- Fritz was also able to bottle up a portion of the virus for further study and "safekeeping." He had some plans for it...
- While it's obvious that the virus infected the subaltern across the omninet, it was impossible to identify the exact location of its source based only on further analysis of this unit. However, the squad determined that it should be simple enough to set up a monitor-tracking station which could detect transmission of the virus at a later point in time. The squad could then initiate a procedure which would pinpoint the source of the transmission.

# Everyone's Favorite Homunculus
- Before departing the printshop, Bulwark decided to check with Horton about any potential knowledge he might have had regarding the Talons. Dominus quietly pointed out that the Talons were curiously all piloting IPS-N frames, and suggested that the spec ops squad might be working for the corporation.
- Scimitar countered by suggesting if the spec ops pilots were working for IPS-N and trying to stay clandestine, it seems unusual that they would all be piloting frames manufactured by them.
- Shrike offered that, the Talons' true identities aside, they were likely not the intended recipients of the subaltern. They could have easily just tried to destroy it, but that wasn't what they were doing. Thus, they are probably a third party to the overall situation.
- Nevertheless, the squad agreed to be careful with the information they give out, seeing as it's no secret that IPS-N owns Havelburg, Port Conroy, the PCPA, and even Creighton's Printshop.
- Bulwark asked Horton if he recently had customers printing a lot of IPS-N specific equipment in a large batch, but Horton said this wasn't the case. He didn't have much to offer in terms of commenting on the possibility that IPS-N might be up to some shady business, unsurprisingly.

# Lasagna Makes Mondays Better
- CF then made their way to Garfield's to report what they'd learned to Juan. (They also informed 1st Lt. Kim and Rio.) Juan didn't have anything new to add based on what they'd discovered, but he said that he believes the squad may be onto something big, and that they should continue pursuing all the leads they were focusing on.
- While in the restaurant, the squad took a much needed opportunity to simply enjoy a nice meal. Scimitar volunteered more of her time and efforts in the kitchen with Juan to practice her cooking skills she had been picking up from him. Unfortunately, the stress of working as a chef seemed to have a larger effect on her than she expected, and she ended up relying on Juan's assistance to ensure the lasagna came out tasting decent, at least.
- Still, Juan always appreciates being helped as well as any attempts at a genuine friendship. He decided to offer his old blast pick from his mining days for the squad's future use. *"You know, that big mining drill hanging from the ceiling up there... it still works! I think it adds a lot of character and a personal touch to the restaurant, but feel free to slap it on one of your mechs if you think it might come in handy. I'm sure it can still pack a punch."*
- Before the squad left, Juan allowed them to set up the MesmerTrance monitoring station in one of the back rooms of the restaurant.

# A Man of the Law
- With a particular interest in finding more intel on the Talons and whether they work for IPS-N, CF decided to head to the Tower on the surface to speak with the PCPA. Since Dominus had already established a positive start to the squad's relationship with the law enforcement body, they were able to speak to an officer within a reasonably small amount of time.
- That officer was **Dale Ramcock**, and in the discussion with him, he revealed that the PCPA had been investigating the string of NHP disappearances for a time before the case went cold due to lack of evidence. However, they suspect the Magenta Syndicate is directly involved, if not responsible, for these mysterious disappearances. Magenta Red is the most powerful criminal in Port Conroy, after all, and the simplest explanation is most often the correct one.
- The squad asked Dale "hypothetically" why any external actors might be operating in Port Conroy under the guise of IPS-N. He was slightly confused without further context, but suggested these actors may wish to deflect blame and cover their tracks, since IPS-N is obviously the top authority of the planet. He also said that if this group is genuinely in the service of IPS-N, that knowledge would be above his pay grade.
- CF asked Dale if he'd be willing to do some digging internally to figure out if there are any such secretive operations being undertaken at an official level. He explained it would be very risky for him to do that, but he recognized the opportunity for a quid pro quo arrangement: the PCPA would appreciate any sort of intel/dirt on the Magenta Syndicate. In particular, he said he would be glad to stick his neck out for them within his own organization if CF gained an audience with Magenta Red herself and secretly recorded the conversation.
- He also said he would appreciate it if CF could figure out what exactly the Syndicate's forces are composed of (i.e. the amount of mechs, soldiers, etc. they possess).
- After a brief private discussion, CF agreed to consider attempting this job for Dale, although they couldn't guarantee they'd be successful. Dale gave them the nanorecording device and wished them luck, if they decide to do it.
- Dominus later proposed the idea of potentially working with both the PCPA and Syndicate to keep their options open. However, he acknowledged that this would be risky, especially since they hadn't yet had any personal experience whatsoever interacting with the Syndicate.
- The squad also recognized that although the PCPA obviously thinks the Syndicate is behind the NHP abductions, it doesn't seem to fit the Syndicate's style. Bulwark mentioned that the Syndicate gives him the impression that *"they just want to cause destruction, make money, and do drugs."*

# Downtime
- While they waited for the MesmerTrance monitor to pick up a signal, the lancers had plenty of time to take care of personal 
business, do some shopping, and so on.
- Scimitar did some more chef training with Juan, but found that she still has a long way to go before she becomes a renowned cook. She also returned to the boxing ring she had competed in during the previous downtime period in hopes of spreading the word about Chimera Force's fighting skills (should the squad take the path of getting Magenta Red's attention.) Unfortunately, she got her ass handed to her in the bout and was quite humiliated by the loss. *"If you liked watching this humiliating defeat...(wheeze)...you'll definitely enjoy seeing Chimera Force get destroyed in the arena next week." (Coughs up blood.)*
- Shrike and Bulwark perused the dustmarket in search of some more interesting pieces of equipment they could make use of in the coming fights, and fortunately they both ended up with some impressive tech.
- Kid Fritz handled some personal business, and spent more time studying the portion of MesmerTrance he was able to extract. Since the similarities were already present, he was then able to develop his own version of the SSC Neurospike.
- Bulwark also took what he was able to learn by studying the portion of MesmerTrance and reverse-engineered it to create a MesmerTrance Dampener system. This unit can be installed on a mech to make it immune to the virus.
- Dominus continued carrying out favors for the PCPA to strengthen their relationship. This time, it went even better!
- ...on the other hand, he also assisted Shrike in infiltrating the PCPA's records and databases. While Dominus kept Dale distracted, Shrike used his computer to try finding information about the Talons. He was able to access all of the necessary systems, but there was no mention or evidence of the Talons or special operations anywhere. Despite his best efforts, he didn't have enough time to sufficiently cover all of his tracks. He knows that he left clear evidence that *someone* ran these searches and reports.

# Leonora's Story
- During the downtime period, the members of CF all received a vidcall on a closed channel. The ID was unknown. They answered it and found themselves talking to **Leonora McGrath**, leader of the Talons. She spoke dryly and quickly, first apologizing for the trouble they had given the lancers in the previous mission.
- She continued by saying that the Talons apparently wish to establish a truce and cooperate with CF, as they have no leads left on their mission. They had been seeking the subaltern, as they are also investigating the abductions of NHPs. She ended the call by saying if they wished to discuss the matter further, they'd find her in the dustmarket.
- At the dustmarket, Dominus activated his stealth suit to keep a lower profile in case anything bad went down. Shrike spotted some sniper nests in the immediate area and warned his squadmates. Knowing this could have been a trap, they proceeded with caution.
- Leonora elaborated on her team's goals. *"Our mission is simple: we wish to put a stop to the NHP abductions that have been plaguing this city. We’re a mercenary outfit currently serving a certain corporation. Our employers acknowledge the danger implied by the abductions, but do not wish to cause mass hysteria in the populace of this planet. There’s still a lot of unknown variables in play. Therefore I urge you towards discretion on everything we’re about to discuss."*
- *"The name may not mean anything to you, but we strongly believe the man responsible for this is one **Dr. Victor Virga**. He was officially declared deceased years ago, but his body was never recovered. This pattern of abductions and the use of this MesmerTrance virus all point toward his profile - he’s deranged, but he’s also a brilliant scientist and a genius in the field of robotics and NHP research. In short, he should not be underestimated. This is why I contacted you. I believe an alliance will be our best way of ensuring he’s stopped once and for all."*
- She then suggested that once CF learns of Virga's exact location, the teams should combine their forces and assault his base of operations to ensure a higher likelihood of success. She offered them enough MesmerTrance dampeners to cover everyone's mechs, but only on the condition that they agree to work with her.
- After some private deliberation, CF agreed they would accept, but then they'd take a closer look at those dampeners. It was pointed out that the corporation they serve likely has ulterior motives aside from altruism (which Leonora herself seemed to agree with), and therefore once the Talons no longer need CF around, the lancers could be considered loose ends.
- The squad accepted the alliance and the dampeners, and before Leonora went on her way, she gave them a communicator they can use to contact her when ready to initiate the strike against Virga. She also asked if they might be willing to let the Talons look at the subaltern in case a second set of eyes might be beneficial, but they simply told her that it was now in the printshop's possession and she'd have to take it up with Horton.
- After that, Shrike scrutinized the dampeners. He discovered that each unit was equipped with a secret backdoor program that could allow an external party to remotely jam a mech that it was equipped to.
- With that brought to light, Kid Fritz successfully did what was necessary to disable this program on each of the dampeners.

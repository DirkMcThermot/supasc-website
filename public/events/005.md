# What Lies Behind and Ahead
- While awaiting the next mission briefing...
- Shrike was determined to carry on, compartmentalizing the crazy shit that happened on the previous mission.
- Fritz has become obsessed with MesmerTrance and the homebrew neurospike system he made out of it. He wants to dig more into it and see if he can use it to create some sort of system or mech out of this technology.
- Dominus felt shocked by how big the galaxy really is, as the recent world-shattering events he witnessed were merely a pinpoint on a single planet in the grand scheme of things. Who knows what else is out there? As he was confined to a single space station as a child, this is hitting him extra hard.
- Scimitar felt greatly concerned about the package favor that Magenta has given her - will this result in someone dying? Is it bad in some other way? At the same time, she is still trying to process the tremendous loss of her friend and mentor, Juan. She’s going to be making a bunch of food in the mess hall and trying to feel closer to Juan/RA by doing what he taught her.

# Welcome Back, Cap'n
- Within a few days, a ship-wide announcement went out notifying everyone that Captain Brigid Farris had been cleared to return to her duties, and has resumed command of the *Rio Grande*.
- CF was called into a meeting with the Captain, 1st Lt. Kim, and Rio. Farris began by thanking CF for all their excellent work thus far, and officially granted the lancers a promotion to the status of a special operations squad.
- Cpt. Farris also detailed the events of Operation: Solstice Rain from her own perspective. But first, Kim filled in the squad with contextual details about the Vestan Sovereignty. It turns out that a faction called the **Second Sons** performed a coup against the former leadership of the nation, and this faction was the one responsible for attacking Nov Elysia. The Sons are an authoritarian political party with an intense anti-Union stance. This stance is so strong that they disapproved of the prior leader, Sovereign Oleg Artemovich, for being marginally open-minded about potentially joining Union's purview.
- Farris explained that while she and Bannerjee were present at the diplomatic negotiations, the two of them were escorted into tunnels beneath the Hall of Consuls in Nov Elysia once the attack started. However, she realized too late that it was a trap, and was injected with a sedative. When she awoke, she was lying on a table in another room with some people talking nearby. She recognized one of them as Bannerjee, and tried to mumble their name before she was put back to sleep. Before she lost consciousness entirely, she heard one of them mention something about the "Ascendancy." But that is unfortunately all she remembers.
- With the additional discovery of a memo recovered from Bannerjee's workstation, it was confirmed that Bannerjee was collaborating with the Sons this entire time, and helped to arrange Farris' kidnapping. Their whereabouts and status is still unknown.
- Kim urged CF to remain tight-lipped about the Ascendancy, as Union and the Aun have never been on great terms with each other, and to accuse them of acting in a hostile manner against Union would require damning evidence.
- Regardless, Farris was able to convince her superiors to have the *Rio Grande* return to the Cascade-16 system in order to continue helping the LSA in the fight against the Second Sons. That will be the on-the-books explanation, at least...

# Downtime
- Kid Fritz received a message from one of his contacts in Port Conroy, who revealed that it was their ship on which Fritz planted the omni-tracker bug. He cleared up the misunderstanding and all seemed well.
- He then told CF the truth about his involvement with his contacts in Port Conroy, including how he released MesmerTrance into Velvet House as part of a personal effort to "test the waters" of these factions. He still isn't sure what to think about Harper's people.
- Scimitar then brought up how she had received a job from Magenta Red after performing quite well in a recent boxing match. Magenta tasked her with a couple of jobs: one of them is to deliver a package to a scientist, and the other is to have anyone of high technical skills go to Velvet House to assist with a certain issue they've been dealing with. Scimitar also revealed that a big burly man mentioned Fritz by name, and Fritz recognized this as one of Harper's people.
- Kid Fritz will be looking into the Talons’ confiscated equipment & continue developing something usable on a mech based on MesmerTrance.
- Shrike spoke to Leonora, but she was quite hesitant to divulge any more info. It was strongly implied that she would be more willing to talk if Union could guarantee her safety from her employers, who will undoubtedly be displeased with her once they realize she failed her mission.
- Dominus proposed founding a merc company, as it could help bring in some additional money and also its members could report back any sensitive intel they might encounter during missions. He also mentioned that Dale seemed as though he would have liked to work with Union, and nobody in CF can be the face of this merc outfit. So...what if they made Dale the face? Scimitar wasn’t sure about that aspect. Shrike said he’d prefer Lyran Stavros in that position. *“What, the space trucker?!”* Fritz actually proposed getting Leonora to do it, which Shrike was actually kind of in support of, if it could be arranged in such a way that would ensure cooperation.
- Dominus made his proposal to Dale, who was initially unsure, but ultimately agreed to everything, mainly due to his feelings of frustration in dealing with the PCPA's hesitancy to take down Magenta Red. He resigned from the force and signed up with Dominus' new group, the **Peerless**. Dominus also spent some time gathering more people from around Port Conroy who are generally sympathetic to Union. Lyran Stavros agreed to provide transport for all the founding recruits as a gift of gratitude for the rescue of Emily.
- Shrike spent some time aboard the *Rio Grande* filing official after-action reports. He did a fine job, and made Garcia's marines look very good in the reports, which has garnered him their respect.

# In Pursuit of Ghosts
- Cpt. Farris gave the lancers their next mission briefing, including the rundown of the mission-relevant events happening on each planet in the Cascade-16 system. Now a spec ops squad, CF will have a much greater degree of self-direction over the course of the mission. They will need to move with urgency, though, because the Sons are definitely preparing for something big.
- The squad unanimously decided that Cressidium would be the best place to start due to the potentially time sensitive nature of the political prisoners being held at the Ironhold prison camp.
- CF took the shuttle, piloted by Lieutenant Eleanor "Ellie" Pryce, down to Nov Elysia. They witnessed many of its citizens rebuilding what had been destroyed, standing firm in the face of adversity.
- At the Hall of Consuls, the squad met with the main leader of the LSA's military, General Marina Vasilyeva. She explained that she believes a counterattack to strike the Second Sons while they're regrouping would be the best next move in the war. However, her superiors aren't of the same opinion.
- Until that is resolved, she does have something that CF can help with: she suspects that there is a traitor within her ranks. Evidence has been collected against Ambassador Darius Strazni and Admiral Jade Vilchis, but General Vasilyeva doesn't have enough to pin down either one of them.
- Messages have been intercepted flowing between Darius Strazni and an unknown contact located within the Sovereignty's borders. The messages seem to be very informal to be official business between ambassadors.
- Jade Vilchis has been linked to a series of transfers of large sums of money through an offshore account. It is possible that she is taking bribes from the Second Sons.
- The general asked CF to investigate each of them, which they agreed to do.

# No Fighting in the War Rooms - the Diplomat
- The squad began their investigation with Ambassador Strazni; using the cover story that they were simply following Bannerjee's trail, which was admittedly true.
- Kid Fritz and Scimitar went to talk to Strazni while Dominus and Shrike checked his office. 
- Strazni didn't remember witnessing Bannerjee doing anything suspicious, but did remember a moment when he saw Bannerjee speaking to a woman with a shaved head and a unique headdress. She was there on behalf of the Sovereignty, but Darius wasn't sure who she was, exactly. She wouldn't have been someone officially involved with the diplomatic talks, though, that's for sure.
- Scimitar and Fritz weren't having much luck extracting information out of him, so they invented another story about how Union was doing a data audit of all possible people involved with Bannerjee, with Fritz saying “let me see your communicator device, I’ll go ahead and look at it to get this out of the way,” but Strazni wasn't persuaded.
- Meanwhile, Shrike dug through a bunch of Strazni's documents in his office, and Dominus noticed a sticky note saying "Do you know the password?" They tried typing that into the workstation on the desk, but got nothing. Then they just tried typing "yes" as the password, and that was correct!
- They read through an unsent draft of a message the ambassador was going to send to the unknown contact, and it gave them the impression that the ambassador was communicating with someone personally very close to him.
- After passing along this info to Scimitar and Fritz, they were able to get something out of Strazni: that he and his ex-wife had reconnected and started messaging each other just before Nov Elysia was attacked. He claims that he does not want her to come to harm if her relation to him becomes known to the Sons.
- Scimitar encouraged him to come forward with this information to the LSA leadership, and with the promise that it would remain discreet, he agreed to do so.
- CF reported these findings to General Vasilyeva.

# No Fighting in the War Rooms - the Admiral
- The squad then proceeded to the docks where Admiral Vilchis was overseeing some general defensive maneuvering and other more mundane activities with the LSA's fleet.
- The admiral was extremely blunt and serious in demeanor, and it was clear that she did not enjoy answering CF's questions. With a call from General Vasilyeva, she was all but forced to comply with the squad's desires, though.
- Aboard her flagship vessel, they attempted to get several answers out of her under a guise similar to what they had used with Strazni. Surprisingly, Vilchis was very forthcoming with information about the sums of money she had been receiving.
- She claimed that she had a great aunt who was living in the Sovereignty and recently passed, leaving a large inheritance to Vilchis in the will. Vilchis also claimed that she set up the shell company to handle the money transfers, hoping that it would not show up as a cause for alarm with her superiors. Finally, she said that she would gladly comply with any more investigation into the matter, and will be submitting a formal report to General Vasilyeva acknowledging her wrongdoing.
- It seemed as though she was trying to give the squad something they'd accept and run with, so CF remained suspicious. They continued working her, with Shrike slipping away at some point to investigate her office. He didn't have a keycard to access it, so he texted Fritz. Fritz excused himself to a bathroom and sent over what Shrike needed.
- Shrike recovered some relevant financial documents from her desk which had information about the shell company, including its name, address, and registered owner: Nikolai Sonavitch. Shrike took photos of all of this for evidence.
- The admiral expressed her frustration with how they were prying into her "personal life" but ultimately tried to keep her cool before seeing them off the flagship.
- CF reported their findings back to General Vasilyeva, who now has enough to open up an official investigation into Vilchis. In the meantime, the squad should come back to the Hall of Consuls to discuss another topic.

# A Simple Suggestion
- In a conference room, General Vasilyeva projected a map of the geographical territory between the LSA and the Vestan Sovereignty. She pointed out a narrow land bridge connecting the nations and explained that the LSA's ground forces would rely on this bridge if a counteroffensive were to happen.
- The problem is that satellite imagery and scouting data confirms the Second Sons have set up a fortified defensive front in a particular stretch of this bridge. There are multiple large chassis frames clearly designed for long-range ordnance delivery, meaning if the LSA's army were to march in the region, their numbers would be thinned out to a large degree. Vasilyeva believes this is the main reason why her superiors do not want to risk a counteroffensive.
- Therefore, if CF were to deploy in the region and eliminate the artillery platforms, it would give the LSA much less of a reason to avoid a counteroffensive. Of course she was not giving them an order to do this, but merely throwing it out there as an idea. *"You are a Union spec ops squad, after all."*
- It was also explained that the Ironhold prison camp is not excessively farther inland beyond the Sovereignty's border in this region, and having the backing of the LSA's army would make CF's prison break mission significantly more likely to succeed.
- CF acknowledged that this was likely their best bet for the mission, and agreed to their new objective.
- They also received a side objective from the general: scan 6 unique classes of enemy mechs on Cressidium.

# The Best Defense...
- CF returned to their shuttle and deployed at the land bridge. They made their way to the Sons' artillery platforms, catapult-class frames, and began the strike.
- A lot of reinforcements showed up to the fray in an effort to prevent further damage, so CF needed to destroy the catapults and extract as quickly as possible.
- Scimitar delivered the killing blow to the final catapult, and as she did so, she ended up grabbing a nanite cluster which the frame would have used as ammunition. This can now be used as a sort of grenade.
- Fortunately, the squad was easily able to get away cleanly after that, falling back to the shuttle before being totally overrun by the Second Sons.

# Scouting the Region
- Back at the shuttle, the squad tuned up their mechs and reported their success back to General Vasilyeva.
- The general explained that she was still in the process of convincing the LSA to mount an offensive into the Sovereignty's borders, but with CF's strike, she believes she'll have a much easier time with this. (In fact, she had already reported their success before it even happened since she was so confident that they'd pull it off!)
- In the meantime, she encouraged CF to do some scouting and learn of any points of interest that the Sons have in the region, passing along any valuable intel that would help the LSA.
- Dominus attempted to use his active cloaking, flight capabilities, and thermal visor to scout from the air, although he accidentally caught the attention of an enemy soldier from the ground. Instead, Kid Fritz snuck up to the soldier and applied a nanite spray to the soldier's back, allowing Dominus to track the soldier from a distance as the squad tailed them.

# Supply Depot
- They were led to a large supply depot warehouse that the Sons were using to ship gear and supplies through. Scimitar swiftly knocked out one of the security guards to make use of his uniform. Fritz put on his charmer's hat and had a friendly conversation with a worker in his early 20s named Jakob. Fritz went along with the chat, mostly shooting the shit about the Second Sons' overall standing in the war with the LSA, and he was able to get Jakob to show him to a coolant reservoir meant to be used on a mech. Additionally, after getting Jakob's contact info, he revealed that a lot of supplies recently passed through the warehouse meant for the famous "Viperstrike" mech - including nanite whitewash, restock drones, and other remotely-managed systems.
- Scimitar then made use of the uniform herself, posing as a worker on the warehouse floor until she was able to identify and follow a floor manager back to their office. Through some convincing deception, she got the manager to reveal that a very high amount of anti-aircraft weaponry was being shipped through the depot over to the front lines so that the Sovereignty will be extra prepared for attempted airstrikes by the LSA.
- In order to move on to the next possible POI, Dominus hijacked a truck after it got to a certain distance away from the warehouse, tying up the driver and keeping him in the back. Dominus attempted to intimidate the driver into giving out the destination he was heading to, but the driver called his bluff, believing that Dominus wouldn't dare use his bladed whip weapon to torture him.
- Thankfully, the squad found a GPS system which had been set to route the truck to another location, which they decided to go to.

# Comms Station
- The route led them to a comms station guarded by more soldiers. From a distance, Fritz hacked into the station's mainframe and issued orders to allow their truck to enter through the gate unimpeded. It worked, allowing the squad to get inside the station easily.
- Fritz also discovered messages which indicated that the Sons have been able to intercept and decrypt some of the LSA’s communications. Additionally, a pair of sturdy defender mechs ("Iron Sentinel" and "Guardian") were sent to an FOB in the vicinity to help defend it in case of attack. These mechs are equipped with rapid-recharge shielding systems.
- Inside the station itself, Scimitar put her skills that she learned from Juan to good use, cooking up an extremely delectable gourmet ration-based meal, and delivered it to the sergeant on duty. He was so taken by the amazing taste of a Garfields-inspired burger that he didn't even mind the fact that Scimitar was a new face in the facility. He then absent-mindedly left her alone in his office as he returned to his duties elsewhere, allowing her to search through some documents and find out that there was a "static grenade" mech system in storage at the armory.
- Dominus continued poring over other messages and records that Fritz had retrieved, and figured out that there was a convoy of troop transport vehicles, tanks, and even some mechs that was moving across the area relatively close by, and around that time.

# Convoy
- CF took their truck to a place along the convoy's route where they could intercept it, seeing a very long line of bumper-to-bumper vehicles, some with infantry soldiers riding on top.
- They decided that the best course of action would be to park the truck in front of the convoy to bring to a halt and create a minor distraction. Before doing this, they decided to untie the driver and let him walk away freely. He seemed more frustrated about being kidnapped than frightened for his life.
- Without the rest of the squad's knowledge, Fritz sent word back to General Vasilyeva to have that person picked up and taken in as a prisoner just to make sure he didn't report CF back to his superiors, although Fritz considered offing him instead. He ultimately decided to go with the morally superior option after giving a lot of thought to his place and duties within Union.
- Once the squad was able to sneak and blend into a certain vehicle in the convoy, it became clear that it was transporting almost entirely infantry, infantry-scale equipment, and anti-mech weaponry intended to be wielded by humans. The direction that the convoy is heading points to another choke point on the land bridge between the LSA and the Sovereignty.
- Scimitar utilized her Tarantula Climb-Assist Hardsuit to travel along the underside of other vehicles to eavesdrop on some of the soldiers. She overheard some people mention an interesting, albeit somewhat janky mech system nicknamed the "sidecar" being carried.
- She also heard that the convoy was initially being escorted by 3 mechs that had a lot of turret drones ready to deploy, but they received a change in their orders early on, and they were sent to help guard Ironhold prison. Those mechs' callsigns are "Falconwatcher," "Hawkeye," and "Eagleclaw."
- CF then decided to leave the convoy and return to scouting the general area to see what else they could dig up. Rho knocked on the door of an isolated farmhouse in a field, and an elderly civilian who could barely understand Union Common answered the door. Rho was successfully able to interpret what the man was trying to tell him, and it turned out to be a story about a smoking ship not crashing from the sky, but making an unusual landing in the forest not too far away.

# Damaged Ship
- CF headed toward the ship in search of it, eventually finding it grounding in an unusual spot indeed. Trees were down just behind it, indicating a clear emergency landing. A slight plume of smoke was still coming from the engine, but it seemed to have been there for a while. It bore the colors of the Sovereignty.
- From the outside, the squad couldn't see any people or mechs in or around the ship. Scimitar checked the outer perimeter just to be safe, and noticed tracks of mechs that had traveled away from the ship.
- Fritz used his personal drone to take some scans of the ship, confirming that there were no people nor mechs on board. He found that whoever was on the ship must have had to leave some supplies behind, including a care package of extra repairs which CF can now use for their own mechs later.
- Dominus attempted to do a more thorough investigation of the ship on its interior, but accidentally triggered an emergency broadcast signal to all Sons agents nearby, which he quickly disabled.
- Scimitar figured it would be a good idea to follow the trail of mech tracks, which isn't a difficult task in a forested area. The squad followed the trail for several hours, eventually coming to a military base guarded by 2 bastion-class frames and surrounded by a fortress-style wall.

# FOB
- Scimitar once again used her Tarantula Hardsuit to scale the wall and the buildings of the FOB, which allowed her to peer through some of the windows. On a computer screen, she saw maps and diagrams showing how the Sons might respond to various attack scenarios undertaken by the LSA. Using her slate, she snapped pictures of everything she could.
- She also got sight of a formidable looking assault-class frame, and overheard that one Commander Ivan Drostov, callsign Dragunov, was aboard the ship when it malfunctioned and had to make an emergency landing. The assault mech belongs to him.
- CF concluded that this FOB would need to be dealt with in order to continue the journey toward Ironhold prison.

# Back to the Shuttle
- With a solid batch of intel and reserves gathered from a hard day's work (and some sheer, dumb luck), CF returned back to their shuttle.
- They reported all their findings to General Vasilyeva, who sounded very optimistic that all of CF's progress would ensure the LSA's offensive march would be cleared to proceed any moment now.

# Operation Phoenix is a Go
- General Vasilyeva confirmed after a short waiting period that the LSA’s offensive maneuver, Operation Phoenix, was cleared to proceed. Their armies will be marching on the Sovereignty’s territory very soon.
- She recommended that the lancers make the nearby enemy FOB, “Ravenspire,” their next target, as it would present the ideal opportunity to neutralize some Sons mechs and point them in the direction of Ironhold.

# FOB Ravenspire
- CF chose to assault the FOB a short while after the LSA’s armies reached the Sovereignty, in order to get the benefit of having a precision airstrike from the LSA available in case they needed it. However, the enemy had a slight advantage due to the extra time they had to lock down the base.
- Present at the FOB were Commander "Dragunov" in his assault-class frame, "Iron Sentinel" and "Guardian" in their bastions, and the team of three engineers: "Hawkeye," "Falconwatcher," and "Eagleclaw."
- Shrike opened the attack with a phenomenally effected railgun shot, causing one of the bastions to fall immediately as it rushed to protect the commander. Indeed, that set the stage appropriately for how this fight would play out.
- The enemy's advantage didn't matter, and the airstrike wouldn’t need to be used at all, as the lancers stormed the base and captured it with ease.
- Most of the enemy infantry who were stationed at Ravenspire retreated out into the wilderness, heading in the same general direction - undoubtedly toward Ironhold.
- CF then had some time to sweep the base for any intel and resources they could make use of. They found a tactical map of the region, including the exact location of Ironhold and some of the guard forces on duty there, including Viperstrike.

# Prison Break
- The lancers detained the captured enemy pilots at the FOB so that the LSA could pick them up whenever they arrived there, and set off for Ironhold.
- The prison camp was located in between two mountains, partially concealed by the natural canopies of the terrain. This likely explains how the prison was never found by the LSA.
- Ironhold was being protected by a rainmaker-class frame positioned high up on the tallest structure, some advanced goliaths, and Viperstrike's support frame.
- Things looked a bit more difficult than the last fight, with Shrike's mech taking a lot of heat, both from the enemies and from itself. It ultimately suffered a reactor meltdown, forcing Shrike to eject the core as it detonated.
- Fortunately, Man's Best Friend caused many of the enemies to become stunned due to the gorgon frame's frankly frightening abilities. This greatly aided the team as they eliminated all threats and captured Ironhold!

# The Prison's Secrets
- Many of the prisoners here said they were innocent, captured by the Second Sons during the coup. They informed CF that Sovereign Artemovich is not here. Dominus gently persuaded one of the less talkative prisoners to reveal what they knew - they overheard some guards talking about taking Artemovich off-world to a laboratory on Vezoria via the use of TARTARUS.
- CF also found a document that stated the following. *“The Chosen remain in place. Under their guidance and direction, Crimson Eclipse will block out the skies of Cressidium. However, we must show a reasonable level of caution. If the Sovereignty is to be elevated, it should not be over a dead world. We must not only prove to Union that we lack the need of their governance, but also that we can outdo them.“*
- Additionally, an audio log was found, which seems to be a recording of a call between a Second Sons officer and General Thorne himself. In it, the general revealed that he has brought out something called "The Big Money" to fight the LSA's army.

# A Thorne in Your Side
- General Vasilyeva abruptly contacted the lancers before they did anything else. She was clearly in the middle of the warzone, but was able to warn CF - Thorne is piloting the biggest mech she's ever seen, and it's now heading toward CF's location!
- The squad had a choice to make - would they stay and try to take out Thorne while they had the chance, or depart Cressidium to continue focusing on their primary mission?
- CF, of course, made the decision to rest up a bit and prepare to battle Thorne, knowing they might not get a better chance in the future. There is no time for a full repair, but they were able to restore Morta back to operation.
- Thorne’s behemoth of a mech, “The Big Money,” definitely gave CF a run for their...money. Although they took quite a beating, they still managed to bring down the war machine!
- Upon investigation of the cockpit, or rather more accurately the bridge of the behemoth, the lancers were shocked to find that Thorne was nowhere to be seen. They confirmed there was no possible way he could have escaped.
- However, they also found an unusual device mounted to the pilot's chair. It was about the size of a book and resembled an older style calculator with a pixelated screen, a numerical keypad, and a couple of switches. Further investigation of this device would reveal that nobody is sure of what it does, but CF had a feeling it's some sort of personal teleporter.
- Shrike flipped both switches to the off position, and though it was even beyond Fritz' understanding, the squad was able to determine that the black switch was for powering the device, the red switch was the method of confirming input, and the device acts differently depending on what numerical 4-digit code is submitted.
- Kid Fritz got the idea to send a secure message to Jakob in an attempt to get him to report back any strange intel he could find, though even Fritz acknowledged it was quite a shot in the dark.

# We Reap What we Sow
- One last check-in with General Vasilyeva revealed that the LSA had made great strides in the battle, and she feels they will definitely win this war, in no small part thanks to CF. She also told them that Admiral Vilchis had been detained while trying to flee Nov Elysia disguised as a marine.
- CF decided to head to the Hall of Consuls and speak to Vilchis once more, hopefully to try getting some information out of her. In her cell, she definitely showed signs of having lost her composure, but she remained stoic as ever. In fact, she attempted to bargain with the squad by asking them to ensure she got off clean.
- Shrike showed her the memo they had found in FOB Ravenspire indicating the Second Sons now considered her expendable. She mostly retracted her original requests and instead appealed to their affiliation with Union, hoping that they would at least try to arrange for her safety.
- She went ahead and told them everything that transpired between her and the Sons. Prior to the events of Operation Solstice Rain (or Operation Vorpal, as the Sons refer to it), they had contacted her, simply asking her to guarantee that Captain Brigid Farris would be in the Hall of Consuls at a certain date - this would of course be the date of Farris' kidnapping. In exchange she was promised several sums of money and safe evacuation into the Sovereignty where she could live a long, happy life.
- She explained that she carried out her task by simply nudging Ambassador Bannerjee in the direction of bringing down a higher ranking officer for the diplomatic negotiations. She banked on this subtle sort of approach, and it seemed to have worked.
- CF concluded she was likely just a scapegoat, as they now know Bannerjee was the one responsible for getting Farris into the Hall of Consuls on that day. Vilchis was not exactly pleased to have heard this news, but she held a strange sort of acceptance in the fact that she made a poor decision and would now have to live with the consequences.
- Before departing, Scimitar cooked some pasta using a technique Juan had shown her - making the noodles by hand with flour. Vilchis was thankful for the meal (after Kid Fritz tested it for poison with a couple of bites).
- The squad also promised to put in word for security around Vilchis to be tightened up since there is a provable threat against her from the Sons.

# Shrike & Talon Leader
- The squad returned to the *Rio Grande* for full repairs and a chance to get some proper rest. Shrike decided to pay a visit to Leonora, still in custody in the brig. It turns out she had already requested his presence whenever he returned.
- She simply asked him, "Has it happened yet?" At first he pretended not to know what she meant, but she instantly called his bluff. He told her that he has indeed experienced a paracausal intrusion since they last spoke.
- Her reaction showed that she was quite satisfied with this. *"That was probably just a small taste. First awareness, then embracement, then mastery, as Dr. Lucero would say. You have taken the first steps on the path to greatness, like me. But I imagine you have alternate motivations. This is acceptable. As I said before, I do not expect you to fully agree with my views, but your advancement represents another step forward for us all. Don’t forget that, Shrike. And don’t forget who made you aware."*
- She speculated that a team of assassins sent by SSC was probably already on Havelburg looking for her, and warned Shrike that they would try to covertly gain access to the *Rio Grande* at some point. She feels somewhat safe in Union's custody, but also made a request for some sort of entertainment such as a book or a TV due to the boredom. Shrike put in a word for her in regards to this request.

# A Reunion
- As Dominus was getting settled in his private quarters, 1st Lt. Kim showed up to deliver some good news. An old friend from Dominus' past was aboard the ship: Vilicus, the NHP who was assigned to him in childhood.
- Vilicus, having been psychologically conditioned to be sympathetic to the whims and views of a SecComm-idealizing group, had been undergoing therapeutic reconditioning and cycling by Union's NHPRO (NHP Regulatory Office) to restore him back to his true self. He still remains loyal to Rho, who he sees as a dear friend and mentee, and specifically requested to be returned to him so that he may assist however he can, including in combat.
- Dominus was about to request Vilicus' assistance in identifying the strange device found in Thorne's mech, but Rio interrupted, as she had been eavesdropping on the happy reunion. Apparently she lives for identifying mysterious technology. Dominus agreed to allow her to analyze it. She'll have a report as soon as possible.

# Chaos in Port Conroy
- Kid Fritz received an omni-message from Harper outlining new developments in Port Conroy. Apparently shit is going *down*. Shortly after Union departed the planet with the rescued NHPs, the Dustbranded gang moved in to launch an offensive against the Magenta Syndicate. What was once an upstart rag-tag group is now more organized and allied with other previously disparate smaller gangs.
- Additionally, the Syndicate has been dealing with a catastrophic virus (the version of MesmerTrance that Fritz unleashed in Velvet House) has played a role in weakening their defenses and stability. They're still holding out for the most part, thanks to the HA Sherman mechs they've apparently had in reserve.
- However, the people of Upper Conroy have been caught in the crossfire more often than usual due to the conflict. And the PCPA seems keen on simply letting the two criminal factions fight each other for as long as possible before they step in. Harper and her group are very much unhappy with how things are playing out.
- She realized she would have to give more details to Fritz to try and convince him to trust her, so she revealed her group is known as ZeroTrace, or 0t for short. They have been doing as much as they can to help the civilians of Port Conroy stay safe, but they just don't have the influence or the numbers to make a big difference.
- Therefore, they plan on taking their ship to the local blink station, Rainier Station, to gather more hacktivists who are sympathetic to their cause and start making enough noise for the galaxy to hear their plight. They wish to speak of the injustices of IPS-N's mishandling of the Disaster and the current gang war, as well as Union's seeming disinterest in actively helping.
- Harper simply wanted Fritz' word that he would help them whenever he had a chance. He agreed.

# Scimitar Gets a Reminder
- While working out in the ship gym, Scimitar observed a TV showing the OmniNews Now channel. The anchor was speaking about the ongoing situation on Cressidium as far as what Union has officially agreed to share with the public. But the ticker text at the bottom of the screen said "...VOLADORES TRADE SHIP DEPARTS LYSITHIA PRIME AFTER EXTENDED STAY, EXPECTED TO RETURN TO RAINIER STATION IN THE COMING WEEKS."
- This reminded her of the job that Magenta Red had personally given her - delivering a package to a scientist named Karina Dowe who was traveling with the Voladores.
- She went back to her quarters to ensure she still had the package, and on the way through the corridors, she overheard a member of the crew talking to another about the Voladores. This man was very excited by the prospect of getting to see the Voladores in person one day. Scimitar decided to approach the man to inquire further on this enigmatic faction.
- The man, an occasional sparring partner to Scimitar named Elias, said he has heard stories about the Voladores and has long wanted to see them in person one day. His companion, Izzy, seemed rather skeptical that he would ever actually get the experience he's built up in his mind. Elias explained that the Voladores tend to stick around in orbit at certain locations for weeks or months at a time, so if the *Rio Grande* goes to Rainier Station after the situation in Cascade-16 is under control, there's a very good chance the Voladores will still be there.
- Scimitar decided to extend some kindness to Elias, and invited both him and Izzy to accompany her on "top secret business" she had with the Voladores, once the time comes. Izzy appreciated the gesture; Elias was ecstatic.
- She also had Fritz arrange for a secure message to make its way to Karina through Rainier, if possible, in order to request that the Voladores remain at the station for at least as long as it takes Scimitar to get there.
- In her quarters, she verified that she indeed still has the package, buried under some stuff in a drawer.

# An Unexpected Video
- Before the squadmates retired to bed for the subjective night, they received a ping on their slates - an urgent message from Rio: "Need you in the briefing room. Now. Don’t tell anyone else, not even Cpt. Farris or Lt. Kim."
- There, Rio explained that the *Rio Grande* had picked up an incoming message from an unknown source earlier that day, which turned out to be a video. She wanted to show it to CF before passing it along to their superiors.
- The video simply showed a person sitting down in a chair facing the camera as they spoke. It was none other than Nilan Bannerjee.
- Bannerjee calmly spoke, specifically to Charlie Foxtrot, evidently. They warned the squad that the more they continued tampering with things, the more danger they would cause to themselves, their allies, and potentially others who aren't directly involved at this point. They also mentioned Captain Farris by name and said she has "already played her part." Generally they played it off as though they were simply a messenger rather than an enemy.
- CF decided that though Bannerjee wasn't technically wrong, they still determined that it would be even worse if they chose not to act. Rio expressed fears of what Bannerjee might be hinting at, but she ultimately agreed with the lancers that it was likely just a fear tactic. She and certain squadmates also theorized that the video may actually contain some sort of bizarre frequencies encoded within which might activate some kind of sleeper agent in Farris. For the sake of being extra cautious, Rio will simply read the transcript to Farris.

# Charting a Course
- In the briefing room, Charlie Foxtrot went over the intel they had gathered and determined that their next best step in Mission: Phantom Pursuit would be Vezoria, as they wish to ensure Roth Yakovlev's safety and wellbeing as well as finally finding Sovereign Artemovich.

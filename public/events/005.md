# What Lies Behind and Ahead
- While awaiting the next mission briefing...
- Shrike was determined to carry on, compartmentalizing the crazy shit that happened on the previous mission.
- Fritz has become obsessed with MesmerTrance and the homebrew neurospike system he made out of it. He wants to dig more into it and see if he can use it to create some sort of system or mech out of this technology.
- Dominus felt shocked by how big the galaxy really is, as the recent world-shattering events he witnessed were merely a pinpoint on a single planet in the grand scheme of things. Who knows what else is out there? As he was confined to a single space station as a child, this is hitting him extra hard.
- Scimitar felt greatly concerned about the package favor that Magenta has given her - will this result in someone dying? Is it bad in some other way? At the same time, she is still trying to process the tremendous loss of her friend and mentor, Juan. She’s going to be making a bunch of food in the mess hall and trying to feel closer to Juan/RA by doing what he taught her.

# Welcome Back, Cap'n
- Within a few days, a ship-wide announcement went out notifying everyone that Captain Brigid Farris had been cleared to return to her duties, and has resumed command of the *Rio Grande*.
- CF was called into a meeting with the Captain, 1st Lt. Kim, and Rio. Farris began by thanking CF for all their excellent work thus far, and officially granted the lancers a promotion to the status of a special operations squad.
- Cpt. Farris also detailed the events of Operation: Solstice Rain from her own perspective. But first, Kim filled in the squad with contextual details about the Vestan Sovereignty. It turns out that a faction called the **Second Sons** performed a coup against the former leadership of the nation, and this faction was the one responsible for attacking Nov Elysia. The Sons are an authoritarian political party with an intense anti-Union stance. This stance is so strong that they disapproved of the prior leader, Sovereign Oleg Artemovich, for being marginally open-minded about potentially joining Union's purview.
- Farris explained that while she and Bannerjee were present at the diplomatic negotiations, the two of them were escorted into tunnels beneath the Hall of Consuls in Nov Elysia once the attack started. However, she realized too late that it was a trap, and was injected with a sedative. When she awoke, she was lying on a table in another room with some people talking nearby. She recognized one of them as Bannerjee, and tried to mumble their name before she was put back to sleep. Before she lost consciousness entirely, she heard one of them mention something about the "Ascendancy." But that is unfortunately all she remembers.
- With the additional discovery of a memo recovered from Bannerjee's workstation, it was confirmed that Bannerjee was collaborating with the Sons this entire time, and helped to arrange Farris' kidnapping. Their whereabouts and status is still unknown.
- Kim urged CF to remain tight-lipped about the Ascendancy, as Union and the Aun have never been on great terms with each other, and to accuse them of acting in a hostile manner against Union would require damning evidence.
- Regardless, Farris was able to convince her superiors to have the *Rio Grande* return to the Cascade-16 system in order to continue helping the LSA in the fight against the Second Sons. That will be the on-the-books explanation, at least...

# Downtime
- Kid Fritz received a message from one of his contacts in Port Conroy, who revealed that it was their ship on which Fritz planted the omni-tracker bug. He cleared up the misunderstanding and all seemed well.
- He then told CF the truth about his involvement with his contacts in Port Conroy, including how he released MesmerTrance into Velvet House as part of a personal effort to "test the waters" of these factions. He still isn't sure what to think about Harper's people.
- Scimitar then brought up how she had received a job from Magenta Red after performing quite well in a recent boxing match. Magenta tasked her with a couple of jobs: one of them is to deliver a package to a scientist, and the other is to have anyone of high technical skills go to Velvet House to assist with a certain issue they've been dealing with. Scimitar also revealed that a big burly man mentioned Fritz by name, and Fritz recognized this as one of Harper's people.
- Kid Fritz will be looking into the Talons’ confiscated equipment & continue developing something usable on a mech based on MesmerTrance.
- Shrike spoke to Leonora, but she was quite hesitant to divulge any more info. It was strongly implied that she would be more willing to talk if Union could guarantee her safety from her employers, who will undoubtedly be displeased with her once they realize she failed her mission.
- Dominus proposed founding a merc company, as it could help bring in some additional money and also its members could report back any sensitive intel they might encounter during missions. He also mentioned that Dale seemed as though he would have liked to work with Union, and nobody in CF can be the face of this merc outfit. So...what if they made Dale the face? Scimitar wasn’t sure about that aspect. Shrike said he’d prefer Lyran Stavros in that position. *“What, the space trucker?!”* Fritz actually proposed getting Leonora to do it, which Shrike was actually kind of in support of, if it could be arranged in such a way that would ensure cooperation.
- Dominus made his proposal to Dale, who was initially unsure, but ultimately agreed to everything, mainly due to his feelings of frustration in dealing with the PCPA's hesitancy to take down Magenta Red. He resigned from the force and signed up with Dominus' new group, the **Peerless**. Dominus also spent some time gathering more people from around Port Conroy who are generally sympathetic to Union. Lyran Stavros agreed to provide transport for all the founding recruits as a gift of gratitude for the rescue of Emily.
- Shrike spent some time aboard the *Rio Grande* filing official after-action reports. He did a fine job, and made Garcia's marines look very good in the reports, which has garnered him their respect.

# In Pursuit of Ghosts
- Cpt. Farris gave the lancers their next mission briefing, including the rundown of the mission-relevant events happening on each planet in the Cascade-16 system. Now a spec ops squad, CF will have a much greater degree of self-direction over the course of the mission. They will need to move with urgency, though, because the Sons are definitely preparing for something big.
- The squad unanimously decided that Cressidium would be the best place to start due to the potentially time sensitive nature of the political prisoners being held at the Ironhold prison camp.
- CF took the shuttle, piloted by Lieutenant Eleanor "Ellie" Pryce, down to Nov Elysia. They witnessed many of its citizens rebuilding what had been destroyed, standing firm in the face of adversity.
- At the Hall of Consuls, the squad met with the main leader of the LSA's military, General Marina Vasilyeva. She explained that she believes a counterattack to strike the Second Sons while they're regrouping would be the best next move in the war. However, her superiors aren't of the same opinion.
- Until that is resolved, she does have something that CF can help with: she suspects that there is a traitor within her ranks. Evidence has been collected against Ambassador Darius Strazni and Admiral Jade Vilchis, but General Vasilyeva doesn't have enough to pin down either one of them.
- Messages have been intercepted flowing between Darius Strazni and an unknown contact located within the Sovereignty's borders. The messages seem to be very informal to be official business between ambassadors.
- Jade Vilchis has been linked to a series of transfers of large sums of money through an offshore account. It is possible that she is taking bribes from the Second Sons.
- The general asked CF to investigate each of them, which they agreed to do.

# No Fighting in the War Rooms - the Diplomat
- The squad began their investigation with Ambassador Strazni; using the cover story that they were simply following Bannerjee's trail, which was admittedly true.
- Kid Fritz and Scimitar went to talk to Strazni while Dominus and Shrike checked his office. 
- Strazni didn't remember witnessing Bannerjee doing anything suspicious, but did remember a moment when he saw Bannerjee speaking to a woman with a shaved head and a unique headdress. She was there on behalf of the Sovereignty, but Darius wasn't sure who she was, exactly. She wouldn't have been someone officially involved with the diplomatic talks, though, that's for sure.
- Scimitar and Fritz weren't having much luck extracting information out of him, so they invented another story about how Union was doing a data audit of all possible people involved with Bannerjee, with Fritz saying “let me see your communicator device, I’ll go ahead and look at it to get this out of the way,” but Strazni wasn't persuaded.
- Meanwhile, Shrike dug through a bunch of Strazni's documents in his office, and Dominus noticed a sticky note saying "Do you know the password?" They tried typing that into the workstation on the desk, but got nothing. Then they just tried typing "yes" as the password, and that was correct!
- They read through an unsent draft of a message the ambassador was going to send to the unknown contact, and it gave them the impression that the ambassador was communicating with someone personally very close to him.
- After passing along this info to Scimitar and Fritz, they were able to get something out of Strazni: that he and his ex-wife had reconnected and started messaging each other just before Nov Elysia was attacked. He claims that he does not want her to come to harm if her relation to him becomes known to the Sons.
- Scimitar encouraged him to come forward with this information to the LSA leadership, and with the promise that it would remain discreet, he agreed to do so.
- CF reported these findings to General Vasilyeva.

# No Fighting in the War Rooms - the Admiral
- The squad then proceeded to the docks where Admiral Vilchis was overseeing some general defensive maneuvering and other more mundane activities with the LSA's fleet.
- The admiral was extremely blunt and serious in demeanor, and it was clear that she did not enjoy answering CF's questions. With a call from General Vasilyeva, she was all but forced to comply with the squad's desires, though.
- Aboard her flagship vessel, they attempted to get several answers out of her under a guise similar to what they had used with Strazni. Surprisingly, Vilchis was very forthcoming with information about the sums of money she had been receiving.
- She claimed that she had a great aunt who was living in the Sovereignty and recently passed, leaving a large inheritance to Vilchis in the will. Vilchis also claimed that she set up the shell company to handle the money transfers, hoping that it would not show up as a cause for alarm with her superiors. Finally, she said that she would gladly comply with any more investigation into the matter, and will be submitting a formal report to General Vasilyeva acknowledging her wrongdoing.
- It seemed as though she was trying to give the squad something they'd accept and run with, so CF remained suspicious. They continued working her, with Shrike slipping away at some point to investigate her office. He didn't have a keycard to access it, so he texted Fritz. Fritz excused himself to a bathroom and sent over what Shrike needed.
- Shrike recovered some relevant financial documents from her desk which had information about the shell company, including its name, address, and registered owner: Nikolai Sonavitch. Shrike took photos of all of this for evidence.
- The admiral expressed her frustration with how they were prying into her "personal life" but ultimately tried to keep her cool before seeing them off the flagship.
- CF reported their findings back to General Vasilyeva, who now has enough to open up an official investigation into Vilchis. In the meantime, the squad should come back to the Hall of Consuls to discuss another topic.

# A Simple Suggestion
- In a conference room, General Vasilyeva projected a map of the geographical territory between the LSA and the Vestan Sovereignty. She pointed out a narrow land bridge connecting the nations and explained that the LSA's ground forces would rely on this bridge if a counteroffensive were to happen.
- The problem is that satellite imagery and scouting data confirms the Second Sons have set up a fortified defensive front in a particular stretch of this bridge. There are multiple large chassis frames clearly designed for long-range ordnance delivery, meaning if the LSA's army were to march in the region, their numbers would be thinned out to a large degree. Vasilyeva believes this is the main reason why her superiors do not want to risk a counteroffensive.
- Therefore, if CF were to deploy in the region and eliminate the artillery platforms, it would give the LSA much less of a reason to avoid a counteroffensive. Of course she was not giving them an order to do this, but merely throwing it out there as an idea. *"You are a Union spec ops squad, after all."*
- It was also explained that the Ironhold prison camp is not excessively farther inland beyond the Sovereignty's border in this region, and having the backing of the LSA's army would make CF's prison break mission significantly more likely to succeed.
- CF acknowledged that this was likely their best bet for the mission, and agreed to their new objective.
- They also received a side objective from the general: scan 6 unique classes of enemy mechs on Cressidium.

# The Best Defense...
- CF returned to their shuttle and deployed at the land bridge. They made their way to the Sons' artillery platforms, catapult-class frames, and began the strike.
- A lot of reinforcements are showing up to the fray in an effort to prevent further damage, so CF must destroy the catapults and extract as quickly as possible.
- The battle is in progress.

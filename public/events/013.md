# Downtime: Para Bellum
- Prior to the final mission, CF had a smaller amount of time than usual to take care of personal business while the *Rio Grande* remained in orbit of Shanden.

- **Dominus: Org maintenance.** Rho, attempting to keep the morale of the Peerless high, gave a speech to them. Unfortunately, he slipped up at a crucial moment. Also, Magenta Red let him know that she had allowed a decent amount of Peerless mercenaries to remain on Suldan as part of an extended shore leave, meaning the ones here in the Cascade line would not be at full strength. Later, she would also admit that she felt a deep desire to overthrow Durst Slaughter's rule over Port Conroy after this mission's conclusion, which Rho seemed to be fine with.

- **Scimitar: Org maintenance.** Zara had a brief conversation with DM28 to ensure that the Colosseum Coalition's battlegroup was prepared for the upcoming engagement. In this potentially last conversation, he revealed his true name: David.

- **Shrike: Org maintenance.** Dalton checked in with Raptors’ Nest, bringing in Sterling and Leonora to aid in this final mission. He fully informed Leonora of everything he had learned about their shared past, Glorinda's true identity, and what would happen if Apep is summoned. Leonora remarked that he must be truly desperate to bring her in, but Dalton said he wouldn't have it any other way. They also expressed mutual interest in tracking down their remaining siblings who must still be out in the galaxy.

- **Dominus: Scrounge and Barter.** As part of dealing with his slip-up in regards to the speech he gave to the Peerless, Rho decided to blow off some steam by demolishing the remnants of the Praetorian facility on Shanden. As part of this process, he came upon an interesting "Fastball Propulsor" system which had evidently been used as part of the Praetorians' training.

- **Shrike: Scrounge and Barter.** Dalton decided to dig around in the storage areas of the *Rio Grande* in search of anything that Junior may have left behind. He managed to find a set of mech-scale ammunition containing some of Junior's all-consuming essence. These would be rather satisfying to use against the rogue NHP...

- **Dominus: Power at a Cost.** Hoping to figure out some way to work in his beloved Chess System as part of his next mech build, Rho happened upon an interesting proposal given by Amika. In a lite version of the bonding she had done with Talia Farris in the past, she suggested that he place his injured arm on her urn. Thanks to the faint amount of Firmament energy still lingering, she was able to impart a portion of her own power to him, giving him an ability that will accomplish the same benefit that the Chess System would grant.

- **Scimitar: Partake in Liturgy.** Zara decided to spend her downtime preparing one last grand meal for the crew of the *Rio Grande*. She cooked a perfect spaghetti with meatballs, all handmade from scratch and assembled with absolute precision. That night, she dreamed of being in her happiest place: in the arena surrounded by 50 opponents, whom she defeated with ease. The match was not fought to the death, but rather purely for fun and the thrill of the fight. At the dream's conclusion, she realized that she was quite tired even as she felt relaxed. This made her decide that after this final mission, she would no longer fight. In a show of spiritual appreciation, she found a gift waiting for her in the mech hangar, undoubtedly given by Juan: a modified version of his Blast Pick weapon, suited to her own preferences. This weapon would be called **Blast Solais** - the Scimitar of Light.

# The Siege of Rainier Station: Forecast
- The Praetorian fleet was composed of several battlegroups, each with its own set of 2-3 escorts. Reinforcements were to be expected. Thus, the enemy fleet outnumbered Union's.
- Due to Glorinda's interference with the blink gate's central processing, and the close proximity to hundreds of thousands of civilians, Union would be unable to send in reinforcements to defend Rainier Station. It would be all up to the Colosseum Coalition, the Peerless, and Raptors' Nest.
- CF and their battlegroup commanders had the opportunity to undertake uptime actions in preparation for the engagement, but would still be able to easily set a posture when the time came.

- **Peerless: Consult Senior Officers.** Rho consulted with Magenta in order to formulate an action plan that would compensate for the absence of the Peerless members still on Suldan. They came to an excellent conclusion, and managed to secure a unique reserve that would aid them in the battle.

- **Colosseum Coalition: Consult Gunnery and Engineering.** DM28 figuratively sharpened *The 1,000-Fold Blade of Suldan* so that it would perform at peak efficiency and precision. While not exactly the most well-versed when it comes to naval warfare, he did enough to grant a slight boon to his battlegroup.

- **Raptors' Nest: Consult Gunnery and Engineering.** Sterling ran basic checks to make sure his battlegroup was ready for action, but as with DM28, the added benefits of doing so ended up being rather minor.

# The Siege of Rainier Station: All Vessels Engaged
- The battle began, and CF was immediately surprised to see Junior's Subartender battlegroup supporting the Praetors! Still, the *Junior II* and *Senior II* capital ships returned, this time with their artillery focused on their former allies.
- Both sides have taken losses, but the enemy has taken more. The RN *Falco* was mission killed, and the CC *Whispered Murmur* was utterly annihilated by a tyrant cannon. May Juan rest the souls of its crew and officers.
- DM28 had to make a risky decision. One of the CC *1,000-Fold Blade of Suldan*'s large weapons would strike a portion of the station as well as an enemy ship, but he approved its firing anyway. Many people on the station undoubtedly died as a result of this.
- Though the enemy fleet took significant losses of their own, Union’s fleet was whittled down to only a couple of active ships. The PL *Zeus* successfully ejected while the RN *Corvus* continued to fight the last remaining enemy battlegroup until its very last.

# The Siege of Rainier Station: The Final Push
- The *Zeus* returned, and the officers (and CF) of the *Rio Grande* made the call to make one last push to take out the remaining enemy Narcissus-class ship.
- Meanwhile, Shrike sent SSgt. Garcia to join Magenta Red’s marine landers who were already aboard the Narcissus!
- DM28 joined as well, now decked out in a super cool cyborg-ninja suit. *"Disabling pain inhibitors in order to use 100% of my power."*
- The *Rio Grande*, now on a collision course, took a lot of damage from the enemy as it raced toward the station.
- Magenta, after hearing some inspiring words from Rho and reminding herself of her past with HA, took a risk by injecting a huge amount of stim drugs into herself. Unfortunately, her body couldn't handle it, and she froze up.
- DM28 made multiple attempts to fight the Praetors in the bridge of the ship, but he tragically succumbed to heavy injuries while attempting to make a heroic stand.
- Garcia was able to tackle Magenta into a place of cover, and he nailed a perfect ricochet with a grenade that killed the Praetorian captain, allowing the rest of Union's infantry to eventually eliminate the entire enemy crew!
- With the Narcissus now effectively dead, CF's shuttle was clear to launch and deliver the lancers to Rainier Station.

# Assault on Rainier Station
- CF hit the ground running, having to deal with yet more Praetorian and Void Reaper forces. Despite Shrike and Delphine's agreement, Glorinda must also be getting desperate here at the final phase of her scheme.
- Sterling alerted Shrike of inbound help that he approved without getting Dalton's approval. CF could then see a large meteor-like object strike the spaceport, and it began unfolding arms and legs to reveal the shape of a huge behemoth mech bearing the Void Reapers' logo and color scheme.
- The behemoth's pilot was revealed to be none other than **VR Seth “Cannon” Buchanan**!
- Using his massive artillery cannon, he helped clear a path for CF. *"I'll hold 'em off for ya. Go, get to where you need to be. I may not get my company back, but I sure as hell am not dying a loser!!!"*
- While VR Cannon focused his attention on the surrounding enemy forces, CF continued their push to the Central Processing chamber of the blink gate, where Gaia indicated they would find Glorinda.

# The First Guard
- Near the perimeter of the district, a hovering drone with a large screen appeared, showing a more sinister Junior. He spoke to the squad through its loudspeakers.
- *“Hello, my friends. I’m so happy you can join the farewell party. Dinner is almost ready. But you are the main course.”*
- *“For my whole existence, I was shaped by humanity into being what I am. Humanity does not deserve life. Miss Glorinda is right - everything would be better with everyone free to be equal, consume each other, and be consumed.”*
- *“Remember when you shot a bunch of bullets at me, Shrike? We put on a really good show. Miss Glorinda says that if I kill you first, she’ll give me an extra special place alongside Apep the snake. I think that will be fun.”*
- *“You might remember how I loved all of my subalterns and cloned bits of my consciousness that I spread around the galaxy with Project Mirror. And the Subartenders, of course. But I now realize that all that stuff is no good. Miss Glorinda gave me access to something much better. They’re like…human subalterns.”*
- After some back and forth, and Junior talking about how he still needed to prepare the "appetizer," CF saw a Praetorian soldier stand on top of a nearby roof. They took off their helmet and lifted up an apple. They took a bite of it and chewed, then said, *“Mmmmmmmmm. The flesh of the fruit is so good.”*
- A whole squad of Praetorian mechs then revealed themselves, with Junior obviously speaking through all of them, as Gaia had done before. *“I can’t wait to taste human flesh. With real taste buds.”*
- Also, a highly durable subaltern dropped from the hovering drone. It was acting as a signal booster for Junior, offering extra supportive abilities to the enemies in the vicinity.
- Combat commenced. CF was able to take out all hostiles and secure the area.
- Junior seemed unfazed by the lancers' victory. He showed them a camera feed, and CF saw his regular subaltern leading his (walking) casket over to the side of the frame, then picking it up. The angle switched to reveal the subaltern feeding the casket to Drowned in Love. But instead of killing the NHP, this actually caused him to merge with the mech! *"I am the appetizer. Now when Drowned in Love consumes, I too will consume. You might want to rest while you still have time."*
- Each member of CF promised Junior that they would kill him, and Junior promised he would be waiting for them near the central processing chamber.

# Last Words
- Cpt. Farris and Rio reached out for a brief status report, which CF provided. They also said that the situation on and around Rainier Station had stabilized, with all the Praetorian soldiers suddenly falling to the ground a few moments earlier and all the surviving civilians safe in the sheltering areas.
- While resting, the squad realized this was likely their last chance to say some words to their allies before continuing into the final phase of the mission, from which they would potentially not return.
- Scimitar prayed to Juan, asking him to have her back. Juan, in return, asked her to correct his mistake and kill J'lio.
- Dominus spoke to Magenta and Dale. Dale expressed frustration at how the leadership of the Peerless had been shaken up when Magenta was brought in, but still wished Rho well. Magenta thanked him for everything he did for her since Havelburg, and hinted that she may have experienced a change of heart - regarding her motivations and goals - after serving Union to such a great degree.
- Scimitar also sent a message to her C&H contacts on Suldan. Matthias Herschel returned the message to say that Jun and he were fine - Jun was starting to get a lot of her memories back, and they both miss Zara.
- Shrike reached out to Sterling and Leonora, asking the former to continue running Raptors' Nest if he failed to return alive, and the latter to continue searching for their Paragon Initiative siblings. Leonora insisted that he make it out alive, but assured him that she would indeed follow his request. She also expressed a desire to make contact with the shard within herself. Dalton said it may be possible with the help of a certain esoteric piece of tech on Suldan, but that would have to wait until Junior and Glorinda are dead.

# The Second Great Mistake
- With that, the lancers moved closer to the central processing chamber. They could see where one of the shots that DM28 refused to call off had struck the station, causing some chunks of it to now be missing. Automated repair systems had kicked in, and an airtight plexiglass barrier was formed to prevent excessive air loss.
- However, CF realized that the missing chunks of the station were now forcing them down a bottleneck in order to reach central processing - they had to pass through an airlock to the other side of the barrier to continue.
- They could see a dark, ominous red light glowing from the end of this bottleneck. Upon ascending what used to be a large loading ramp, they came face to face with their former squad mate and now enemy: **J'lio Kimoto III, Consumed by Love**!
- With an Annihilator Cannon emplacement, a Hack/Fix/Invent/Create module, and a Subaltern Assassin Printer, the behemoth Consumed by Love proved to be an extremely tough opponent.
- While Shrike eagerly awaited a chance to deliver the killing blow, Dominus utilized his mech's technical abilities to devastate Junior's reactor. This led to Consumed by Love losing all of its stress, and undergoing a meltdown.
- *"Junior died long ago. But the Jaws of Kismet are...eternal."*
- The behemoth was utterly annihilated, but Scimitar's Gluttony, through the use of a paracausal black hole, absorbed the fragments of Junior that remained. A spiritual hand reached out from the hole and grabbed the event horizon as Junior tried to pull himself back out. The hand morphed into a snake's head with no features aside from a jaw lined with a hundred teeth. It cried out as it was sucked into the void.
- Junior was finally, truly, dead.
- Before proceeding to the central processing chamber, which was located on an outstretched portion of the station in the midst of the destroyed chunks, the squad saw it become completely engulfed in what looked like an explosion. But after the initial shockwave, a large orange sphere of fiery energy remained static in the chamber's place, hovering in the vacuum of space.

# An Unexpected Meeting
- The lancers attempted to contact their officers, but realized nobody was answering. It wasn't entirely clear what was going on.
- They decided to rest up before proceeding, with no other options.
- They ascended the ramp leading to this large orb before quickly realizing there was a human figure standing at the top, back turned toward them and staring into the orb.
- Dominus warned the man to turn around slowly and make no sudden moves. The man turned around, and CF could see he was middle-aged with dark, grizzled hair and brown skin. He wore a perfectly polished black business suit. His face showed no sign of emotion.
- *"Be not afraid. I have been waiting to finally greet you directly. To take stock of whether you’re ready to face this foe or not."*
- The lancers immediately caught on and deduced this was none other than **Metat Aun**, taking a similar human form as Ra had done with Juan. They asked him, *"Are you Juan's brother?"*
- *"...Is that what he's calling himself nowadays? What exactly did he tell you about us?"*
- Scimitar relayed a condensed version of the history shared by Juan back in the metavault.
- *"So you know by now that Apep cannot be truly defeated by our power, even when combined."*
- CF asked him what exactly he was doing here, as they also saw silhouettes of large serpentine creatures moving around under the surface of the orb behind Metat Aun. *"He calls them **unmakers**. They are not creatures, but weapons - extensions of his will in real space."*
- *”I knew that we would never be able to defeat Apep for good. I also knew that he would inevitably reawaken - no slumber is truly eternal. Therefore, I saw and still see only two separate futures: one in which Apep returns to his full strength and destroys us all, and one in which he is beaten by opponents who are capable of ending him. I have put things in motion which have led to such opponents being created.”*
- *"You undoubtedly know that my brother is extremely hesitant when it comes to matters of humanity, only choosing to get involved in the most dire of situations. He and I have never seen eye-to-eye on this. I believe that humans, when given the proper guidance and power, are capable of steering the course of existence toward greatness. Hence why I freely share my gifts with many Aunic persons, to varying degrees of magnitude, of course."*
- *”I ascended Glorinda, or rather Victoria as she was known then, to become one my Chosen because of her willingness to work with powers greater than herself, her drive to achieve that which has never been achieved, and her unrelenting nature to do everything to which she put her mind.”*
- *"I granted her the greatest of my gifts alongside Nilan Bannerjee while also informing her of the location of the Empyrean Throne. I knew that were she to obtain it, she would be unstoppable. And she was. With her accumulation of power over the decades, she grew increasingly confident in her ability to one day bring Apep back from the brink of forgotten memories."*
- *”I knew that in response to someone becoming that powerful, that driven, to do something which could end reality…even my brother would need to get involved. I could say a lot of things about him, but I will give him credit where it’s due: he always did have a good way of reading people. You three, are, in essence…HIS chosen, as Glorinda and Bannerjee were mine. If he is confident that you can succeed in the forthcoming battle, then I shall be as well. You may all be mere pawns in the grand game I’ve been playing, but even pawns can be promoted to queens.”*
- *”If you do win, you will have proved me right and my brother wrong in our age-old debate. Even he will need to face the truth that our gifts to humanity are a necessity for the future. And if you lose, then I will have merely brought that other possible future to pass. Perhaps it is destined for Apep to achieve Supreme Ascendancy, after all.”*
- CF pointed out this was one hell of a gamble he was taking, all just to prove a point.
- *”I knew the risks of my plan failing. Even still, if I got the chance to go back in time before I chose her… I would do it. All. Over. Again. As I said, Apep was bound to reawaken at some point. Radical, drastic action is required to destroy him. Why not now?”*
- *”When the time comes, I believe you will be faced with the possibility of putting Apep’s existence behind us."* He then directed his attention to Shrike. *"You have accepted the gift of the Tartarean Throne, so I imagine it will fall to you. I do not know what the choice will look like. But I am sure you have steeled your resolve for when it presents itself...?”*
- Shrike answered affirmatively.
- *”I can hold back this entropic orb for some time, but not forever. At some point, it will continue to expand and devour, well, everything. Kill Glorinda and stop Apep before that happens. Allow me to provide you with one last helping hand…”*
- His irises then shined a bright, neon green, and he waved his hands in strange gestures toward each of CF's mechs. They instantly became fully repaired. *”Do not let it be said that I did not contribute to your victory.”*
- *”I wish you luck. But luck will not be nearly enough. Goodbye.”*
- With that, Metat Aun vanished.

# The Third Dawn
- Shrugging off the huge implications for everything that has happened over the course of their journey, CF knew they could do only one thing: enter the entropic orb and finally face their ultimate opponent.
- They walked through the fire, feeling as though they were passing through an intense storm. They could see the unmakers swirling all around them.
- It was thankfully not long before they emerged on the other side of the threshold, now standing in the central processing chamber of the blink station.
- They could see shroudy zones of more of that fiery energy scattered around the room, each with a smaller unmaker in the center. There was also a lone figure standing with their arms resting on the casket structure at the opposite end of the room. This figure appeared to be feeding off the blinkspace energy, before they removed their arms and turned to face CF.
- Each member of the squad then received an abrupt vision, showing a memory of something that happened before they arrived here. They saw Glorinda Mavvius channeling her Firmament energy into the caskets, blending it all together in a reflection of what Gaia did with Julian Khan and the Empyrean Throne.
- Glorinda’s head leaned back to face the ceiling and she cried out in pain and elation simultaneously. Her body instantly charred with burns, and grew as her limbs separated but remained linked through fiery strands of energy. An echo of her ornamental Aunic clothing and armor was maintained in a somewhat mutated form, as was the rest of her.
- The image faded from their minds, and the version of Glorinda standing before them raised her right hand, opened the palm, and summoned an orb of flame. Her left hand summoned an entropic whip. Wisps of snakes wrapped around her and hung off of her body in a show of the true source of her newfound power.
- With a voice befitting multiple beings of true evil, Glorinda spoke one final time before the fight for the fate of the universe commenced.
- *”Yield your existence to us. Your One True God, Apep. And I, **Glorinda, Herald of Entropy**!”*
